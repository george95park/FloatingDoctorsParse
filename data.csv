$Introduction,
Guideline Use,"The following guidelines have been written while taking into account the local population and resources most readily available to our organization. Whenever possible, the guidelines should be followed as written. However, patients should always be treated individually. At time, it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines for individual patients or if specific resources are low.

The following guidelines will cover the treatment of the most common presentations that will be seen in our clinics. As you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. The following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as with consideration of what is practically available and possible in our setting. Please discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers, who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. Even relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons. The Lead Medical Providers are there to ensure that the treatment each of our patients receives, meets Floating Doctors standards. Treatment plans may differ between the communities also, depending on the local resources and closest health care facilities."
General Treatment Principles,"We ask that you:

- Follow the tratment guidelines for each condition to determine the first line treatment determined through careful consideration of this population and our resources.
- Utilize the British National Formulary (BNF) for adults and children.
    - Please check any medications you are not familiar with using (i.e., side effects and contraindications), as all of those details are not included in these guidelines.
- Ensure the patient is aware of name and dosage of every medication prescribed.
- Place a script in each bag of medication, including:
    - Name, dose, and duration of medication.
    - Indication
    - Any special instructions (i.e., time of day to take, with food, etc.)
- Go over each script verbally as not all patients are able to read written Spanish.
- Record all prescriptions very clearly in the management section of the patient file and code appropriately.

,
$Common Presentations,
2.1 Fever,
Presentation,"- Usually present with subjective fever that can be taken as genuine in this setting
- Chills, rigors, sepsis"
Causes,"Although the fever is frequently of viral origin, serious illness must be excluded1
- Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection
- Pneumonia
- Pyelonephritis
- Dengue
- Malaria (less likely)
- Bacterial meningitis
- Skin infections
- Malignancy"
Investigations,"- Full intake, including respiratory rate and heart rate.
- Establish pattern and duration of fever.
- For children:
    - Pay attention to skin, throat, ears, chest to identify source of infection.
    - Enquire about gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.
    - Urine test."
Diagnosis,"- Temperature >38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F)

Axillary temperature underestimates core body temperature by approximately 0.5 degrees Celsius. 2 Therefore, add 0.5 degrees Celsius to any axillary measurements."
Management8,"Infants (aged 0-28 days)
    - “All febrile neonates aged 0-28 days old should be hospitalized for presumed sepsis and treated with antibiotics pending culture results (48 hours).3,4”

Infants (aged 28-90 days)
    - “All febrile infants aged 28-60 days, after having a sepsis evaluation, should be hospitalized and empirically started on intravenous antibiotics pending culture results.3”
    - Infants aged 28-90 days will require a number of investigations for which hospitalization is necessary. Regardless of hospitalization outcome, these children still require follow-up every 24 hours until the fever has resolved and all cultures are negative.5

Infants (aged 3 months-3 years)
    - “Febrile children aged 3 months to 3 years are evaluated based on epidemiologic and focal findings revealed during the history taking and physical examination as well as whether or not these children are at low risk for serious bacterial infections3,6.

Identification and appropriate management depends on the underlying cause. In the case of self-limiting viral infections, the only management required is advice and reassurance.
If meningococcal disease is suspected, give parenteral antibiotics at the earliest opportunity (either benzylpenicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin).

Health Education for patients and relatives
    - Stress importance of adequate, and increased fluid intake.
    - Do not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets.
    - Don't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.
    - Cool baths and tepid sponging are not recommended.

Antipyretic drugs
    - Fever is the normal response of the body to infection and unless the child becomes distressed or symptomatic, fever alone should not be routinely treated.There is evidence that host defence mechanisms are enhanced by a raised temperature.
    - Antipyretics (eg, paracetamol and ibuprofen) should therefore not be used routinely but can be of value, especially for patients with systemic disease (particularly heart failure or respiratory failure) and when fever causes acute confusion.
    - Consider either paracetamol or ibuprofen as an option if a child appears distressed or is unwell.

Pharmacological Treatment (consult BNF or BNF for children)

First line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen
Second line: Ibuprofen

** Please avoid maximum dosing where appropriate. Higher dosing is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment **"
,
2.2 Headache,
Causes,"In our setting one of the most common causes is dehydration9.
Awareness of this and advice to patients to increase oral intake is therefore vital.
Other causes include10:

Primary Headache
- Tension
- Migraine
- Cluster headache

Secondary Headache
The list of causes of secondary headaches is exhaustive and can be found elsewhere9,11. It is included but not limited to: meningitis, giant cell arteritis, sinusitis, visual problems."
Investigations,"History
    - Establish patient’s normal fluid intake. Most of population drink only 1-3 glasses of water a day, often while working in the sun!
    - A good history is critical to the diagnosis and management of headache. Particular attention must be paid to red flags12:
        - New onset headache
        - Onset after age 50 years
        - Change in pattern of headache
        - Worsening headache
        - Acute or sudden onset
        - Sudden onset during exertion, with coughing, with sneezing, sex-related
        - Headache with postural link
        - Headache in a setting of malignancy or HIV
        - Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, cough)
        - Neurologic symptoms or signs

Exam
Normal intake will be performed. In case of red flags, ensure a full neurological exam is performed - including fundoscopy (to rule out papilloedema)."
Diagnosis,"Whilst access to investigations during Floating Doctors’ clinics will be somewhat limited, a simple history and examination will be ascertain the cause in most scenarios.

If any red flags or concerning features are elicited, please discuss with a Lead Medical Provider. Depending on the urgency of the situation, we can:
    - Arrange an emergency hospital appointment.
    - Attempt to expedite secondary care at a later date."
Management,"1. Simple Dehydration Headache
Health Education13
- Encourage ways to increase fluid intake (i.e., coconut juice, filtered/boiled water, soups, fruit, vegetables)
- Explain importance of water in body
- Advise reduction of caffeinated beverages
- Explain that as a gross marker when urine is clear, they have drank enough water

Pharmacological Treatment
First line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen

2. Migraines 13,14
Health Education
- Advice about triggers (i.e., coffee, cheese, stress)
- Encourage a symptom diary where the patient can recognize their triggers

Pharmacological Treatment
- Acute: Combination of an NSAID and an antiemetic (i.e., ibuprofen and metoclopramide)
- Chronic: Regular prophylactic medication can be considered if the patient is having more than 2 migraines per month13–15
    - First line: Propranolol
    - Consult BNF for dosage and contraindications"
,
2.3 Musculoskeletal Pain,
Causes,"“Musculoskeletal pain is a known consequence of repetitive strain, overuse, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. These injuries include a variety of disorders that cause pain in bones, joints, muscles, or surrounding structures. The pain can be acute or chronic, focal or diffuse. Low back pain is the most common example of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Other examples include tendonitis and tendinosis, neuropathies, myalgia, and stress fractures.16”"
Presentation,"- Many patients describe a long history of generalized muscular pain, worse after work
- Knee, back, shoulder pathology is common"
Investigations,"History
- A thorough history can often elucidate a likely cause. Exclude history of direct trauma, deformity, or acute pathology (ongoing infection/ septic joint).
- For back pain, pay particular attention to red flag features 16,17:
    - Thoracic pain.
    - Age of onset less than 20 or more than 55 years.
    - Loss of control of the bowel or bladder.
    - Weakness or numbness in a leg or arm.
    - Foot drop, disturbed gait.
    - High fever.
    - Saddle anaesthesia (numbness of the anus, perineum or genitals).
    - History of carcinoma.
    - Structural deformity.

Examination
- Depending on the affected joint, it is necessary to perform a focused examination to guide management and follow up
- If back pain is associated with bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anaesthesia, a digital rectal exam can be extremely valuable 18. Similarly, neurological examination can be useful if a patient has neurological symptoms."
Management,"Health Education 19
- Give appropriate exercises and stretches; physiotherapy can be extremely beneficial.
- Heat packs can be made easily with a cloth and warm water.
- General lifestyle advice on posture, moving, and handling techniques.
- Reassure patient that muscular pain is normal after working hard and it tends to subside with time. Advise them to return to next clinic or seek further medical advice if needed.

Pharmacological Treatment
1st line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen
2nd line: Ibuprofen

Depending on availability we may have access to:
Topical NSAIDs, Depo Medrol injections

If any alarming symptoms are elicited, hospital work-up either as an inpatient (in emergencies) or as an outpatient can be facilitated."
,
2.4 Rash,
Presentation,"Patients, typically children, present with acute or chronic rashes. Often these are nonspecific and the underlying diagnosis can seem unclear."
Causes,"Common types of skin rash that we encounter include:
- Scabies
- Impetigo
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis
- Folliculitis
- Insect bites
- Cutaneous leishmaniasis

It is important to be aware that skin rash can be due to more sinister causes20. These include meningococcal disease, malignancy, non-accidental injury or TB."
Investigations,"Children in the communities are usually fully vaccinated, and often the mothers will have a card to prove it. Thankfully this makes a lot of the more serious infections less likely. If you are in doubt regarding vaccinations as the mother for the child's card or ask the Lead Medical Provider if the community in question has a good vaccine program (some communities have less access than others unfortunately)."
Diagnosis,"History 21
- Past medical history, family history, occupation, hobbies, drugs.
- Duration of lesions
- Have there been previous episodes?
- Does the lesion persist or change?
- Where is/are the lesion(s) (check mucous membranes)?
- Provoking or relieving factors
- Associated symptoms: Itch, tenderness, bleeding or discharge, systemic symptoms
- Has patient previously received treatment?

Examination
Do a thorough examination. If required, consider using the private room
- The diagram below may help with diagnosis

(PICTURE)
Taken from 22

Another option is to take a photograph of the lesion (provided the patient/ family consent) that can be uploaded to SERMO for secondary advice."
Management,"This will vary depending on the underlying cause.

To see if the started treatment is effective you can ask the patient to return to the Friday Follow-Up on single-day clinics (or Thursday morning on multi-day clinics). . Special therapies may be acquired and brought back during Follow-Up if they aren’t ones we stock regularly.

Health Education
A high proportion of the cases we see will be infective. Therefore, measures to prevent spread can be useful. These include 21,23:
- Hand washing
- Please hand soap to the patient
- Avoidance of itching
- Use a tissue, or cough and sneeze into your arm, not your hand. Turn away from other people.

Pharmacological Treatment
For the treatment of dry skin/ itching, we often have the following items available:
- Coconut oil (aceite de coco)
- Calamine lotion
- Oatmeal bath
- Steroid cream trial

Infective
Bacterial - Triple antibiotic cream, consider systemic antibiotics if necessary
Fungal - Topical Clotrimazole 1% or Nystatin, oral antifungals may also be used

Non-Infective
Hydrocortisone cream can be used"
,
2.5 Dehydration,
Presentation,"There are numerous signs and symptoms of dehydration. These include but are not limited to24:
- Dry mouth/ lips
- Lack of tears
- Not keeping any fluid down
- Not making urine/ dry nappies
- Lethargic/ confused"
Causes 24,"** NEEDS TO BE LOOKED OVER -GP **

Common causes that we often see are listed in bold
Gastrointestinal
Gastroenteritis Gastrointestinal obstruction - eg, pyloric stenosis: often associated with poor intake, vomiting. Bowel ischaemia may cause extensive capillary leak and shock.Oropharyngeal (pain may severely limit oral intake)
Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitisEndocrine
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Diabetes insipidus: excessive output of very dilute urine. Thyrotoxicosis: increased insensible losses and diarrhoea. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)Others
Febrile illness: fever causes increased insensible fluid losses. Burns: fluid losses may be extreme and require aggressive fluid management. Heat stroke Cystic fibrosis: excessive sodium and chloride losses in sweat."
Investigations,"Assess the level of dehydration.

** NEEDS A TABLE ----- MAYBE A PICTURE OF THE TABLE? **
Mild Moderate Severe Weight loss Less the 5% 5-10% >10% General condition Well, alert Restless, irritable Unconscious Eyes normal sunken Sunken Mouth +tongue normal dry Very dry Pulse Rate normal fast Weak and fast Respiratory Rate normal increased Fast Capillary return Normal (<2secs) Moderate (>2secs) Severe (>3 secs) Skin pinch quick slow Very slow Thirst Drinks normally (not thirsty) Drinks eagerly (thirsty) Drinks poorly (not thirsty) Urine output Normal no of wet nappies Reduced number of wet nappies Poor"
Management 25–27,"General principles for diarrhoea and dehydration in infants/children:
Tell mother/carer
1. Give extra fluids
    - More frequent and longer duration of breastfeeding
    - If not exclusively breastfeeding or not taking the breast give ORS/SSS 10ml/kg/hr or food with liquid content
    - After each loose stool give extra fluid
    - Up to 2 years: 50 to 100 ml after each loose stool 2 years or more: 100 to 200 ml after each loose stool

2. Continue feeding
    - Restart food as early as possible, good foods include banana, cereals, bread: avoid sugary foods.

3. Seek medical attention if…
    - Dry mouth/lips.
    - Lack of tears.
    - Not keeping any fluid down
    - Not making urine/Dry nappies. Lethargic/confused.

4. If a child looks moderately dehydrated or you have any concerns, give the child ORS in clinic and observe closely over 4 hours.
    - If patient not improving, then consider IV fluids or hospital admission. Ideally review patient again in 24 hours.

5. Zinc supplements OD 10 days (2-6 months: 10mg, 6 months–5 years: 20mg).
If available zinc decreases the length of diarrhoeal illness and decreases the recurrence of diarrhoeal illnesses29.

6. Determine the amount of ORS to give in the first 4 hours28 (20ml/kg per hour)
** NEEDS A TABLE ----- MAYBE A PICTURE? **
Age 0-4 months 4—12 months 1-2 yrs 2-5 yrs Weight <6Kg 6-10Kg 10-12Kg 12-20kg Fluid over 4 hours 200-450 ml 450-800ml 800-960ml 960-1600ml

If you are more concerned, options are:
    - Arrange hospital admission.
    - We have IV fluids which we can utilize in emergency situation
    - Arrange for the patient to return for Friday Follow-Up

ORS is best, or (clean) water, avoid sugary drinks. ORS is routinely available in clinics, however, a home remedy can be taught for the next time the patient has diarrhoea and/or dehydration.

Sugar Salt Solution (Home remedy)29,30
    - IL clean water (boiled)
    - ½ tsp salt
    - 6 tsp sugar

"
Complications,"Shock can result from hypoperfusion25,26.

Arrange emergency transfer to secondary care25:
    - Pale or mottled skin.
    - Cold extremities.
    - Decreased level of consciousness.
    - Tachycardia/ Tachypnoea
    - Weak peripheral pulses.
    - Prolonged capillary refill time.
    - Hypotension."
,
2.6 Malnutrition,
Presentation,"Malnutrition refers to a nutrient deficiency state of protein, energy or micronutrients31.

In adults, the Body Mass Index can be used to detect malnutrition. A BMI below 18.5 is classed as underweight32. Beware of solely using this to diagnose malnutrition however as oedema can mask weight loss in some circumstances33. Other signs in adults include34: somnolescence, frequent infections, delayed wound healing and poor concentration.

For children, the WHO criteria for identifying children with severe malnutrition are34,35:
    - Bipedal oedema.
    - Visible severe wasting.
    - Weight for height more than three standard deviations below the median of international reference population.

Look for signs of the following 3 clinical syndromes (mixed pictures may occur)36:
    - “Marasmus: Obvious loss of weight with gross reduction in muscle mass, especially from limb girdles. Subcutaneous fat virtually absent. Thin, atrophic skin lies in folds. Alopecia and brittle hair. Sometimes, appearance of lanugo hair.
    - Kwashiorkor: Usually occurs in children aged 1-2 years with changing hair colour to red, grey or blonde. Moon facies, swollen abdomen (pot belly), hepatomegaly and pitting oedema. Dry, dark skin which splits were stretched over pressure areas, to reveal pale areas.
    - Nutritional dwarfism: Patient is small for age. Face shape may be affected by size of teeth.”"
Causes,"There are a number of risk factors that place individuals at a higher risk of malnutrition. These include36,37: extremely young age, poverty, coexisting chronic illness or developmental delay and mental health problems."
Investigations,"Use Children Growth Charts to guide your diagnosis.
Calculate the patient’s Body Mass Index.
The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool screening tool can also be used to identify malnutrition risk38:

*** PICTURE HERE ***"
Management,"General advice on the importance of nutritional intake is vital.

The provision of multivitamins in children boosts micronutrient intake39 and can have positive effects on growth40. As such we routinely give multivitamins to all children.

The use of supplements is more useful than advice alone in the elderly41. From time to time we have Mannapack supplements. These can also be beneficial.

If children <5 are (severely) malnourished please consult a Lead Medical Provider about the option of Fundacion NutreHogar."
"Complications 40,42","- “Impaired immune response and increased risk of infection.
- Reduced muscle strength.
- Impaired wound healing.
- Impaired psychosocial function, including poor cognition and increased dependency.
- Impaired recovery from illness and surgery.
- Poorer health outcomes.
- Poor quality of life”"

3.1 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,
Presentations,"Common signs/symptoms include47
    - Nasal discharge/ obstruction
    - Sneezing
    - Sore throat
    - General malaise
    - Cough
    - Hoarseness, loss of taste and smell, mild burning of the eyes and a feeling of pressure in the ears or sinuses, due to obstruction and/or mucosal swelling, may also occur. Headache and fever tend to be less common symptoms."
Causes,"Adults
    - Allergic versus nonallergic rhinitis
    - Pharyngitis
    - Influenza
    - Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever)
    - Whooping cough

Children

Infants
    - Consider the possibility of more serious conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia."
Management,"Health Education
- Reassure parents and advise to increase fluid intake
- Advise patients/ families about the usual course of the illness. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that the average total length of illness is 10 days.
- Antibiotic treatment of URTI does not alter the outcome of the illness or prevent further complications48. Explain that antibiotics may also have side-effects - eg, diarrhoea, vomiting and rash.
- Advise on hygiene measures

Pharmacological Treatment
- Acetaminophen
- Nyquil
- Sodium Chloride 0.9% to clear nose
- Apply Vicks balsam to chest"
,
3.2 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection,
Presentation,"The presentation of these conditions will depend on age, infecting organism and site of infection."
Causes 49,"Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is infection below the level of the larynx and may be taken to include:
    - Bronchiolitis (3.2.1)
    - Pneumonia (3.2.2)
    - Bronchitis"
Investigations,"All patients should have the following measured:
    - Respiratory rate
    - Heart rate
    - Oxygen saturations
    - Blood pressure"
,
3.2.1 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection - Bronchiolitis,
"Presentation 49,50","- Severe viral infection of the LRTI in children <2 years
- Begins as clear nasal discharge for 1 – 2 days, followed by cough and increased work of breathing
- Symptoms will worsen until day 4-5 until begin to resolve"
Causes51,"Most common cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
- Transmitted through droplet inhalation or contact with contaminated secretions"
Management,"Health Education52
    - Explain to mother the timeline of the illness and reassure her
    - Most children able to be manage at home with symptomatic treatment only
    - Fluid intake, adequate nutrition and appropriate thermoregulation are paramount to optimal management. These should be discussed with the parents.

Indications for admission53
    - Poor feeding (<50% usual intake over the previous 24 hours) which is inadequate to maintain hydration.
    - Lethargy
    - History of apnea
    - Respiratory rate >70 breaths/minute
    - Nasal flaring or grunting
    - Severe chest wall recession
    - Cyanosis

,
3.2.2 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection - Pneumonia,
Presentation,"- Cough, difficulty breathing, high fevers
- Look for signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, conscious state"
Causes,"- Viral
- Bacterial"
Management,"Calculate the patient’s CRB-65 score in conjunction with clinical judgement (we don’t have urea levels readily available).

A 4-point score system is used, one point for each of:
    - Confusion (abbreviated mental test score 8 or less, or new disorientation in person, place or time).
    - Respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute or more.
    - Systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg (or diastolic below 60 mmHg).
    - Age 65 years or older


Consider hospital admission for all other patients, particularly those who have a CRB-65 score of 2 or higher.

If well enough to be treated in the community:
    - Increase fluid intake
    - Advice not to smoke
    - Treat fever
    - Advice to seek further medical input or to return for e.g. Friday follow up if clinically necessary

Pharmalogical treatment (consult the BNF/BNF for Children) 51,54

For mild pneumonia
    - Offer a 5-7 day course of Amoxicillin, reserving a macrolide or tetracycline for patients allergic to penicillin. Consider extending the course/hospitalization if there is no improvement at Friday follow up.
    - Add flucloxacillin if staphylococcal infection is suspected - e.g., in influenza or measles.
    - Consider a macrolide if an atypical pneumonia is suspected."
,
,
3.3 Chronic Asthma,
Presentation55,"Features that increase the probability of asthma in adults include56,57:
    - More than one of the following symptoms: wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough, particularly if:
        - Symptoms are worse at night and in the early morning.
        - Symptoms are present in response to exercise, allergen exposure and cold air.
        - Symptoms are present after taking aspirin or beta-blockers.
    - History of atopic disorder.
    - Family history of asthma and/or atopic disorder.
    - Widespread wheeze heard on auscultation of the chest.
    - Otherwise unexplained low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (historical or serial readings).
    - Otherwise unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia."
"Investigations (adapted from 30,33)","History
Undertake a structured clinical assessment to assess the initial probability of asthma. This should be based on:
    - History of recurrent episodes (attacks) of symptoms, ideally corroborated by variable peak flow when symptomatic and asymptomatic.
    - Symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness that vary over time.
    - Recorded observation of wheeze heard by a healthcare professional.
    - Personal/ family history of other atopic conditions (particularly atopic eczema/ dermatitis, allergic rhinitis).
    - No symptoms/ signs to suggest alternative diagnoses.

Exam
'Not all asthma wheezes and all that wheezes is not asthma.'
    - Pay particular attention to pulse (which can be increased due to salbutamol use) and pattern of breathing.
    - Look for chest wall deformities
    - Peak Flow (simple and effective investigation that plays more of a role in the follow up of known asthmatics)"
Diagnosis,"Care must be taken with the differential diagnosis58:
    - In children wheezy bronchitis may be mistaken for asthma.
    - In adults, COPD is the main alternative diagnosis (ask about smoking and exposure to causative dusts).

Treat anyone presenting for the first time with a wheeze for potential tropical pulmonary eosinophilia with Albendazole59. This has the resultant effect of concomitant treatment of worms."
Management (adapted from 56),"Management of chronic asthma

Health Education
    - Inhaler technique is often poor in the communities we visit. Spending time with the patients optimizing their inhaler technique can be extremely effective.
    - Consider making a spacer with an empty water bottle. Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family.
    - Advise patients about symptoms to watch out for and to seek medical advice should these develop60. Asthma can potentially be life threatening. Therefore it is vital that patients are adequately educated about the condition.
    - Ensure dietary calcium requirements are met - inhaled corticosteroids can affect bone mineralisation. At Floating Doctors, we’re fairly limited with the availability of our medications. Medication choices are based on 2016 SIGN guidelines 56.
    - In adults, consider a trial of treatment with low dose inhaled corticosteroid and provide salbutamol for symptomatic relief. 

In severe cases, consider a short course of oral steroids and referral to hospital.

In children it is important to be wary of the potential side effects that may ensue from chronic steroid use. These must be balanced against the benefits that will result from treatment. If you have any queries or concerns, please consult a Lead Medical Provider."
Complications,"“Inadequate control of asthma leads to much morbidity and poor quality of life, with a high rate of working days lost and emergency hospital admissions. Complications mostly relate to acute exacerbations:
    - Pneumonia.
    - Pneumothorax.
    - Pneumomediastinum.
    - Respiratory failure and arrest.”61"
,
3.4 Pulmonary Tuberculosis,
Presentation,"Pulmonary TB is the commonest initial presentation, however it may also be extra-pulmonary; tuberculosis meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis etc.
The possibility of TB should be considered in any person with risk factors for TB exposure, who has suggestive symptoms 62,63. These include:
    - Fever
    - Malaise
    - Pleuritic chest pain
    - Cough longer than 2-3 weeks
    - Night sweats
    - Weight loss
    - Hemoptysis
    - Clubbing
    - Erythema nodosum"
Causes (adapted from 62),"Pulmonary tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary infection heals spontaneously in immunocompetent patients in 90% of cases.
The following people are at high risk of active TB or reactivation of TB:
    - Older adults
    - Infants
    - People with weakened immune systems, for example due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, diabetes, or medicines that weaken the immune system.

Tuberculosis has been on the rise in Panama 62–64. In 2005, 1,565 cases were reported (48.5 per 100,000 population). The areas at greatest risk are the provinces of Kuna Yala (210 per 100,000 population), Ngöbe Buglé (152.6) and Bocas del Toro (107)."
Investigations,"In cases where Tuberculosis is suspected, discuss with the Clinic Manager and Lead Medical Provider. Depending on the location of the patient, they can be investigated (and subsequently treated) for tuberculosis free of charge through MINSA (Ministerio de Salud)."
Management,"Anti-Tuberculous medications are commenced in a hospital based setting. Our role at Floating Doctors is to act alongside the responsible health authorities.
This can involve educating patients about the following:
    - Side effects of their medications and need for regular monitoring (particularly liver function tests).
    - Potential complications that can ensue.
    - Requirement for family screening if other family members develop alarming symptoms.
    - The requirement to complete the course of therapy prescribed.

Often patients can develop other chest symptoms alongside their tuberculosis (e.g. asthma). These must be addressed where appropriate and not simply brushed under the umbrella term ‘tuberculosis’."
Complications (taken from 62–65),"    - Spinal pain: Back pain and stiffness are common complications of tuberculosis.
    - Joint damage: Tuberculous arthritis usually affects the hips and knees.
    - Meningitis: This can cause a lasting or intermittent headache that occurs for weeks. Mental changes also are possible.
    - Liver or kidney problems
    - Heart disorders - Rarely, tuberculosis can infect the tissues that surround your heart, causing inflammation and fluid collections that may interfere with your heart's ability to pump effectively."
