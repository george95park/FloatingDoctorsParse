    "Introduction": {
        "Guideline Use": "The following guidelines have been written while taking into account the local population and resources most readily available to our organization. Whenever possible, the guidelines should be followed as written. However, patients should always be treated individually. At time, it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines for individual patients or if specific resources are low.\n\nThe following guidelines will cover the treatment of the most common presentations that will be seen in our clinics. As you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. The following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as with consideration of what is practically available and possible in our setting. Please discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers, who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. Even relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons. The Lead Medical Providers are there to ensure that the treatment each of our patients receives, meets Floating Doctors standards. Treatment plans may differ between the communities also, depending on the local resources and closest health care facilities.",
        "General Treatment Principles": "We ask that you:\n\n    - Follow the tratment guidelines for each condition to determine the first line treatment determined through careful consideration of this population and our resources.\n    - Utilize the British National Formulary (BNF) for adults and children.\n        - Please check any medications you are not familiar with using (i.e., side effects and contraindications), as all of those details are not included in these guidelines.\n    - Ensure the patient is aware of name and dosage of every medication prescribed.\n    - Place a script in each bag of medication, including:\n        - Name, dose, and duration of medication.\n        - Indication\n        - Any special instructions (i.e., time of day to take, with food, etc.)\n    - Go over each script verbally as not all patients are able to read written Spanish.\n    - Record all prescriptions very clearly in the management section of the patient file and code appropriately.\n"

    "Common Presentations": {
        "Fever": {
            "Presentation": "- Usually present with subjective fever that can be taken as genuine in this setting\n- Chills, rigors, sepsis",
            "Causes": "Although the fever is frequently of viral origin, serious illness must be excluded1\n    - Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection\n    - Pneumonia\n    - Pyelonephritis\n    - Dengue\n    - Malaria (less likely)\n    - Bacterial meningitis\n    - Skin infections\n    - Malignancy",
            "Investigations": "- Full intake, including respiratory rate and heart rate.\n- Establish pattern and duration of fever.\n- For children:\n    - Pay attention to skin, throat, ears, chest to identify source of infection.\n    - Enquire about gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures.\n    - Urine test.",
            "Diagnosis": "- Temperature >38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F)\n\nAxillary temperature underestimates core body temperature by approximately 0.5 degrees Celsius. 2 Therefore, add 0.5 degrees Celsius to any axillary measurements.",
            "Management\u2078": "Infants (aged 0-28 days)\n    - \u201cAll febrile neonates aged 0-28 days old should be hospitalized for presumed sepsis and treated with antibiotics pending culture results (48 hours).3,4\u201d\n\nInfants (aged 28-90 days)\n    - \u201cAll febrile infants aged 28-60 days, after having a sepsis evaluation, should be hospitalized and empirically started on intravenous antibiotics pending culture results.3\u201d\n    - Infants aged 28-90 days will require a number of investigations for which hospitalization is necessary. Regardless of hospitalization outcome, these children still require follow-up every 24 hours until the fever has resolved and all cultures are negative.5\n\nInfants (aged 3 months-3 years)\n    - \u201cFebrile children aged 3 months to 3 years are evaluated based on epidemiologic and focal findings revealed during the history taking and physical examination as well as whether or not these children are at low risk for serious bacterial infections3,6.\n\nIdentification and appropriate management depends on the underlying cause. In the case of self-limiting viral infections, the only management required is advice and reassurance.\nIf meningococcal disease is suspected, give parenteral antibiotics at the earliest opportunity (either benzylpenicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin).\n\nHealth Education for patients and relatives\n    - Stress importance of adequate, and increased fluid intake.\n    - Do not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets.\n    - Don't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.\n    - Cool baths and tepid sponging are not recommended.\n\nAntipyretic drugs\n    - Fever is the normal response of the body to infection and unless the child becomes distressed or symptomatic, fever alone should not be routinely treated.There is evidence that host defence mechanisms are enhanced by a raised temperature.\n    - Antipyretics (eg, paracetamol and ibuprofen) should therefore not be used routinely but can be of value, especially for patients with systemic disease (particularly heart failure or respiratory failure) and when fever causes acute confusion.\n    - Consider either paracetamol or ibuprofen as an option if a child appears distressed or is unwell.\n\nPharmacological Treatment (consult BNF or BNF for children)\n\nFirst line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen\nSecond line: Ibuprofen\n\n** Please avoid maximum dosing where appropriate. Higher dosing is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment **"

        "Musculoskeletal Pain": {
            "Causes": "\u201cMusculoskeletal pain is a known consequence of repetitive strain, overuse, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. These injuries include a variety of disorders that cause pain in bones, joints, muscles, or surrounding structures. The pain can be acute or chronic, focal or diffuse. Low back pain is the most common example of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Other examples include tendonitis and tendinosis, neuropathies, myalgia, and stress fractures.16\u201d",

Similarly, neurological examination can be useful if a patient has neurological symptoms.",
            "Management": "Health Education 19\n    - Give appropriate exercises and stretches; physiotherapy can be extremely beneficial.\n    - Heat packs can be made easily with a cloth and warm water.\n    - General lifestyle advice on posture, moving, and handling techniques.\n    - Reassure patient that muscular pain is normal after working hard and it tends to subside with time. Advise them to return to next clinic or seek further medical advice if needed.\n\nPharmacological Treatment\n1st line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen\n2nd line: Ibuprofen\n\nDepending on availability we may have access to:\nTopical NSAIDs, Depo Medrol injections\n\nIf any alarming symptoms are elicited, hospital work-up either as an inpatient (in emergencies) or as an outpatient can be facilitated."

Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family.\n    - Advise patients about symptoms to watch out for and to seek medical advice should these develop60. Asthma can potentially be life threatening. Therefore it is vital that patients are adequately educated about the condition.\n    - Ensure dietary calcium requirements are met - inhaled corticosteroids can affect bone mineralisation. At Floating Doctors, we\u2019re fairly limited with the availability of our medications. Medication choices are based on 2016 SIGN guidelines 56.\n    - In adults, consider a trial of treatment with low dose inhaled corticosteroid and provide salbutamol for symptomatic relief. \n\nIn severe cases, consider a short course of oral steroids and referral to hospital.\n\nIn children it is important to be wary of the potential side effects that may ensue from chronic steroid use. These must be balanced against the benefits that will result from treatment. If you have any queries or concerns, please consult a Lead Medical Provider.",

Our role at Floating Doctors is to act alongside the responsible health authorities.\nThis can involve educating patients about the following:\n    - Side effects of their medications and need for regular monitoring (particularly liver function tests).\n    - Potential complications that can ensue.\n    - Requirement for family screening if other family members develop alarming symptoms.\n    - The requirement to complete the course of therapy prescribed.\n\nOften patients can develop other chest symptoms alongside their tuberculosis (e.g. asthma). These must be addressed where appropriate and not simply brushed under the umbrella term \u2018tuberculosis\u2019.",
            "Complications (taken from 62\u201365)": "- Spinal pain: Back pain and stiffness are common complications of tuberculosis.\n- Joint damage: Tuberculous arthritis usually affects the hips and knees.\n- Meningitis: This can cause a lasting or intermittent headache that occurs for weeks. Mental changes also are possible.\n- Liver or kidney problems\n- Heart disorders - Rarely, tuberculosis can infect the tissues that surround your heart, causing inflammation and fluid collections that may interfere with your heart's ability to pump effectively."

However patients are often asymptomatic.\n\nWhipworm (trichuriasis) specifically can cause loose stools containing mucus and/or blood, nocturnal stooling and rectal prolapse in the setting of heavy infection. Roundworm (ascariasis) is associated with transient respiratory problems in the beginning of infection. While the most common symptom of pinworm (enterobiasis) is perianal itching (predominantly at night).",
            "Causes": "Roundworm, hookworm and whipworm are some of the most common soil-transmitted helminths in Panama69,70.\nAutoinfection occurs by water, food or hands contaminated with soil. Person-to-person transmission can occur by eating food touched by contaminated hands or by handling contaminated cloths, bed linens or other environmental surfaces. In addition, eggs (e.g. of pinworm) may become airborne, inhaled and swallowed. After ingestion eggs hatch and release larvae in the small intestine and the gastrointestinal tract and cause symptoms.\n\nHookworm is usually transmitted by larval penetration of the human skin. Therefore preventative measures may be to wear shoes.",
            "Investigations": "Detailed anamnesis; including respiratory problems and the question if patients have seen worms in the stool.

            "Diagnosis": "For persistent symptoms unresponsive to initial Albendazole treatment consider doing a stool examination. Eggs can be found when infected with i.e. roundworm and whipworm. The utility of stool examination is limited for pinworm since worms and eggs are not generally passed in the stool.\nCertain infections can cause peripheral eosinophilia in blood examination.",

For persistent symptoms unresponsive to initial treatment get a stool sample. Give 2 doses, separated by 2 weeks if a large worm burden is suspected (e.g. worms seen in stool, vomiting worms or stunted growth).\nIn cases of anemia (with suspected hookworm infection); iron supplements can be given together with the treatment.\n\nHealth Education\nPrevention in endemic areas is extremely difficult. Reinfection is common despite effective therapy. Simultaneous treatment of the households can be warranted given the high transmission rates among families.\nHygienic measures such as clipping of fingernails, frequent handwashing (especially before eating and after defecation), and baths, are also helpful for reducing reinfection and spread of infection. In addition, bedding and clothes should be washed often.\nUsing treated water and careful washing of vegetables and fruits grown in contaminated areas is also important.",
            "Complications": "Complications of roundworm may include obstruction of intestine, biliary, and/or pancreatic duct. Pulmonary ascariasis is rare among individuals in highly endemic areas. Other complications of hookworm may include anemia and impaired nutrition."

Alternatively, Friday follow up can be utilised to acquire the necessary medication and then provide it to the patient.\n\nFor decisions on whether or not to commence new medications, it is usually best to refer onto a specialist. This is because anti-epileptic drugs will often require close monitoring when first initiated 126,127.\n\nRegarding Neurocystericosis, whilst Albendazole can treat the causative Taeniae solium126, it is generally recommended that this be done in a secondary care setting.

Our pharmacy stock of insulin varies. Please liaise with Lead Medical Providers and the Pharmacy Manager about the types of insulin that we have available.\nGenerally speaking, if insulin therapy needs to be initiated it is much better for this to be done in a hospital. If the clinical situation is urgent then perform a urine dipstick to look for ketones as diagnostic work up for Diabetic Ketoacidosis. If positive transfer immediately to hospital.\n\nRemember, not give insulin before giving fluid135. This can cause a life threatening fluid shift.\n\nType 2 Diabetes - Our pharmacy stock is most often limited to Metformin and Glibenclamide. 136,137\nInitial treatment with Metformin (when contra-indicated or not tolerated, consider dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea) If not adequately regulated on Metformin only, add a DPP-4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea (this is where glibenclamide can be initiated).\nWithout HbA1c monitoring, it can be difficult to determine a patient\u2019s level of control. Use a combination of history taking, examination findings and the blood sugar on the day of consultation to guide management. Some patients may have MINSA treatment cards.

        "Information": "Patients knowledge of wound care is generally poor in this area. Initially assess the wound and the need for closure. Assess206,209,210 the mode of injury, time of injury, type of wound, location (proximity to major vessels and nerves), shape of the wound, depth and direction. Also check to for the presence of a potential foreign body and for underlying structural injury.\n\nThe next step is to achieve haemostasis211. This can be spontaneous but may require pressure, elevation or a tourniquet.\n\nPlease be aware of the fact that often the patient will be in a lot of pain! Analgesia is therefore essential.\n\nIn case needed use lidocaine as a local anaesthetic211,212 (up to 3 mg/kg. NB: a 1% solution contains 10 mg/mL). E.g. If a patient weighs 70 kg, use no more than 210mg. This would be 21ml of lidocaine 1%.\n\nThe next step is to clean the area extensively and remove debris. Use saline 0.9% where possible213. If this is not available, use tap water. Tap water has been shown to have as low, or lower, infection rates as proprietary antiseptic solutions214.\n\nWound Closure - The timing of wound closure will be based on your assessment of the wound213,215:\n    - Primary closure: immediate closure can be used for simple wounds <12 hours old with opposable edges. Delayed primary closure: if there is high risk of infection, give prophylactic antibiotics and close after a few days provided there is no infection. This is something that can be done on a follow up day if planned appropriately.\n    - Secondary closure: allow the wound to close by itself if a bite (except on the face) or it has separated edges or infection. This may result in increased scarring.\n\nType of Closure213,215,216\n    - If primary closure is decided upon, generally we have 3 options available: steristrips, tissue adhesives and/or sutures. Bear in mind that sutures will need to be removed. Often this can be problematic in our setting so if this option is chosen an appropriate removal plan is essential.\n    - Steristrips can be used for small wounds or to allow for drainage where needed.\n    - For small superficial lacerations, consider the use of tissue adhesives217 if available.\n    - If sutures are used, advise regarding appropriate follow up. Teach patient or carer to remove sutures in a hygienic way if follow up is not possible. Another option is to consult with a Lead Medical Provider or the Clinic Manager. In some clinic locations there are health workers who are trained to remove sutures. Ensuring that these health workers follow up the wound care after we\u2019re gone can be useful.\n\nThe following guidelines provide a rough idea of when sutures should be removed206,209:\n    - Face: 4-5 days\n    - Neck: 7 days\n    - Arms and back of hands: 7 days\n    - Scalp, chest, abdomen or back: 7- 10 days\n    - Legs and top of feet: 10 days\n    - Palms, soles, fingers or toes: 12-14 days\n    - Overlying a joint: 12-14 days\n\nDressings218\n    - \u201cThe first layer in contact with the wound surface should be non-adherent - eg, a lightly lubricated gauze with interstices.\n    - Occlusive dressings can lead to maceration with retained fluid.\n    - The next layer should be absorbent material to attract any wound exudate.\n    - Finally, soft gauze rolls tape can be used to secure the initial materials in place.\n    - Dressings may not be necessary if the wound is dry and extra protection is not required.\u201d\n\nAnti-infective prophylaxis\n    - Generally speaking the risk of infection in our environment is relatively high. Therefore we advise a lower threshold for use of antibiotics.\n    - Animal Bites127 should be treated with co-amoxiclav alone (or doxycycline + metronidazole if penicillin-allergic or if co-amoxiclav is unavailable).\n\n    - For other cuts/wounds consider the use of dicloxacillin/penicillin to cover for staphylococcal/streptococcal species127,219.\n\n    - Whilst rabies is relatively rare, there have been some cases reported in Panama220. For all dirty wounds (e.g. animal bites or those involving metals), refer the patient to hospital for tetanus vaccination127."
