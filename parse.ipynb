At time, it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines for individual patients or if specific resources are low.\\n\\nThe following guidelines will cover the treatment of the most common presentations that will be seen in our clinics. As you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. The following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as with consideration of what is practically available and possible in our setting. Please discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers, who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. Even relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons.
