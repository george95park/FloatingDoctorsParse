    "Introduction": {
        "General Guideline Principles": "<p>The following guidelines have been written taking into account the local population and resources most readily available to our organization. \n\nWhenever possible, the guidelines should be followed as written. However, patients should always be treated individually. \n\nAt times it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines: for individual patients or if specific resources are low. \n\n<b>All cases where the guidelines are not being followed must be discussed with the Lead Medical Provider supervising the clinic.</b>\n\nAs you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. \n\nThe following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as, what is practically available and possible in our setting. Please regularly discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers (LMPs), who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. \n\nEven relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons. \n\nThe Lead Medical Providers are there to ensure that the treatment each of our patients receives, meets Floating Doctors' standards. Treatment plans may differ between the communities also, depending on the local resources and closest healthcare facilities.\n</p>",
        "Prescriptions": "<p>When prescribing medications please always ensure the patient is aware of the indication, name and dosage of every medication prescribed. This will allow them to inform doctors in the future, including at other health facilities. \n\nThis can easily be done using our Floating Doctors prescription pads (placing a script in with each bag of medications). Please keep in mind not all patients are able to read. \n\nIn the case of an illiterate patient we have special sheets with symbols, these can be found in our provider packs. A useful resource is family members - almost always there will be a family member living in the home who is able to read and help the patient with their treatment.\n                                                                                                                               \nIf a patient is diagnosed with a chronic condition, requiring long-term medication, please fill in a Floating Doctors card for the patient. Details of the diagnosis, medication, blood pressure and blood sugar should be documented and the card given to the patient. The cards can be modified on future visits, depending on the treatment. The cards will allow the patient, and any doctor seeing the patient, to know what we are treating them for.\n</p>",
        "Medication Queries ": "<p>For a list of all the medications we stock and prescribing information for each, please see the 'Essential Medications' section. We also have a hard copy of a 'Essential Medications' document available in clinic. This has information on all the medications we carry including the indications and dosage for each.\n\nIn clinic we also carry the British National Formulary (BNF) for adults and children. Please use the BNF for any medications queries not answered by the essential medications document. It is vital to check side effects and contraindications for all medications prescribed, particularly in children, pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\nIn general we try and be much more conservative with prescribed treatments and only give them if absolutely necessary. \n\nA good example of this is the use of NSAIDs. We often have to ask volunteers to prescribe less NSAIDs because 1) we do not know if the patient has renal dysfunction 2) if the patient develops gastritis/peptic ulcer they often have very difficult access to healthcare 3) often paracetamol is sufficient and NSAID is not necessary. \n\nRisk benefit ratios of treatments can be different than in a provider's home country, our LMPs are there to help with prescribing decisions. Counselling patients on all possible side effects and risks is essential, as it is in all settings.   </p>"

    "Common Presentations": {
        "Fever": {
            "Presentation": "<p>Usually present with subjective fever that can be taken as genuine in this setting.\n\nTemperature > 38 Degrees Celsius.\n\nChills, rigors, sepsis.</p>",
            "Causes": "<p>Although the fever is frequently of viral origin, serious illness must be excluded [1]\n    - Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection\n    - Pneumonia.\n    - Pyelonephritis.\n    - Dengue.\n    - Malaria (less likely).\n    - Bacterial meningitis.\n    - Skin infections.\n    - Malignancy.\n    - Vasculitis/Autoimmune disorders.</p>",
            "Assessment": "<p>A full assessment should be performed to identify the cause(s) of the fever. Multiple sources may be found so always do a full review.\n\n<b>Full intake</b>\nIncluding blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate.\n\n<b>History</b>\nEstablish pattern and duration of fever.\nReview of systems. \n\n<b>Examination</b>\nEach organ system.\n\n<b>For Children</b>\nCheck skin, throat and ears.\nAsk about GI symptoms and seizures.\nUrine dipstick test.</p>",
            "Diagnosis": "<p>Temperature >38 degrees Celsius.\n\nAxillary temperature underestimates core body temperature by approximately 0.5 degrees Celsius. [2] \n\n0.5 degrees Celsius will be added to any axillary measurements at intake.</p>",
            "General Management": "<p><b>Infants (aged 0-28 days)</b>\n\u201cAll febrile neonates aged 0-28 days old should be hospitalized for presumed sepsis and treated with antibiotics pending culture results (48 hours).\u201d [3, 4]\n\n<b>Infants (aged 28-90 days)</b>\n\u201cAll febrile infants aged 28-60 days, after having a sepsis evaluation, should be hospitalized and empirically started on intravenous antibiotics pending culture results.\u201d [3]\nInfants aged 28-90 days will require a number of investigations for which hospitalization is necessary. \nRegardless of hospitalization outcome, \nthese children still require follow-up every 24 hours until the fever has resolved and all cultures are negative.5\n\n<b>Infants (aged 3 months-3 years)</b>\n\u201cFebrile children aged 3 months to 3 years are evaluated, \nbased on epidemiologic and focal findings revealed \nduring the history taking and physical examination \nas well as whether or not these children are \nat low risk for serious bacterial infections [3,6].\n\nIdentification and appropriate management depends on the underlying cause. In the case of self-limiting viral infections, the only management required is advice and reassurance.\n\nIf meningococcal disease is suspected, give Ceftriaxone antibiotics at the earliest opportunity. \n\n<b>Health Education for patients and relatives</b>\nStress importance of adequate, and increased fluid intake.\nDo not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets.\nDon't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.\nCool baths and tepid sponging are not recommended.\n\n<b>Antipyretic drugs</b>\nFever is the normal response of the body to infection and unless the child becomes distressed or symptomatic, fever alone should not be routinely treated.There is evidence that host defence mechanisms are enhanced by a raised temperature.\nAntipyretics (eg, paracetamol and ibuprofen) should therefore not be used routinely but can be of value, especially for patients with systemic disease (particularly heart failure or respiratory failure) and when fever causes acute confusion.\nConsider either paracetamol or ibuprofen as an option if a child appears distressed or is unwell.\n\nPharmacological Treatment (consult BNF or BNF for children)\n\nFirst line: \nParacetamol/Acetaminophen\nSecond line: \nIbuprofen\n\n** Please avoid maximum dosing where appropriate. Higher dosing is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment **\n\n\n</p>",
            "Treatment": "<p><b>Children</b>\nParacetamol/Acetaminophen: \n15-20 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed. \n\n2nd line:\nIbuprofen.* \n1-2 months: 5 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed.\nOver 2m: 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed.\n\n<i>Do not prescribe both together in children</i>\n\n<i>*Do not prescribe in children with rash - due to a potentially severe reaction in chicken pox</i>\n\n<b>Adults</b>\nParacetamol/Acetaminophen. \n500-100mg every 6-8 hrs as needed. \n(Maximum 4g/24 hours). \n\n2nd line: \nIbuprofen 200-400 mg every 8hrs as needed.\n</p>",
            "Notes on NSAIDs": "<p>Higher dosing of NSAIDs is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment.\n\nDon't use Ibuprofen/aspirin in pregnant/breastfeeding women and avoid in those with peptic ulcer disease. \n\nAvoid Ibuprofen in children with fever and skin lesions, a rare adverse effect is worsening of skin lesions in chicken pox, which can be life-threatening. Paracetamol is the drug of choice.\n</p>",

            "General Approach": "<p>Informed consent (below) - the most is to important report signs of infection urgently.\n\nScreen for any contraindications. \n\nDraw up local anaesthetic and steroid and discard needle.\n\nAttach new sterile needle.\n\nMark site (e.g. using needle cover). N.b. Injecting through ink risks tattooing skin.\n\nClean area with appropriate topical antiseptic.\n\nAspirate pre-injection to ensure vessel not entered.\n\nInject using no touch technique (unless full sterility observed).\n\nCover site with sterile dressing.\n\nThe patients should be advised to remain in clinic for 20 minutes post injection.\n\nRelative rest for 24 to 48 hours post injection, particularly if the knee is injected.\n\nReview patient at 24 \u2013 48 hours.\n\nWarn patient about steroid flare of symptoms (usually short lived up to 48 hrs) & advise patient it may be up to 5 days before benefit noted.\n</p>",
            "Use of Local Anaesthetic": "<p>Immediate relief from the anaesthetic as evidence of good placement of the injection.\n\nDecrease the propensity of the glucocorticoid to cause atrophy.\n\nDecrease glucocorticoid crystals acting as irritant or pro-inflammatory factor (so-called post injection flare) before the biochemical effect of the glucocorticoid takes over.\n</p>",
            "Consent": "<p>The patient should be informed about the relevant risks and benefits of the injection. \n\nThe clinician should document that such a discussion has taken place and that the patient has consented to the treatment.</p>",
            "Complications": "<p><b>Infection Risks</b>\nA rare complication of joint and soft tissue injection.  Hand mediated transmission is the major factor contributing to healthcare associated infection. Patient skin preparation is recommended prior to surgical procedures to reduce risk of infection.  However, the absence of skin prep in clinic should not be considered an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a joint injection. \nBefore skin preparation, the skin should be free of visible dirt. The skin preparation should be applied in concentrically enlarging circles beginning at the site of proposed injection. Alcohol based, chlorhexidine based and iodine based preparation are all suitable.\n\n<b>Tendon Rupture</b>\nThere have been case reports of tendon rupture following steroid injection and ingestion. Biopsy studies have demonstrated reduced cell viability and proliferation, reduced collagen synthesis and organisation, and reduced strength as a result of tendon exposure to steroid. Therefore, it is generally best to avoid injecting steroid into the body of a tendon and, unless strongly indicated, avoid steroid injections in the vicinity of tendons at high risk of rupture due to pathology (severe tendinopathy) or anatomical location (Achilles).\n\n<b>Osteonecrosis</b>\nThe risk of osteonecrosis is highest with prolonged, high doses of exogenous steroids, particularly in the presence of other risk factors. Short courses of steroids however have also been shown to increase the risk of this rare complication.\n\n<b>Anticoagulation and joint injection</b>\nIf the INR <4.5 then it is generally considered safe to proceed as bleeding risks are very low. However, it is unlikely the patient will have had a recent INR so you may need to refer the patient to a specialist or for an INR or consider other treatment options. Analgesia options are often limited in these patients. \nThe decision to do these injections in patients who are anti-coagulated requires careful consideration. The risk of halting anticoagulation is often higher than the small risk of bleeding complications, but this should always be weighed. A management plan in the event of bleeding should be discussed with the patient in advance. We have few patients receiving warfarin treatment.\n\n<b>Steroid Type and Frequency</b>\nDexamethasone and Methylprednisolone are the two injectable steroids commonly available to Floating Doctors. There have been some suggestion of cartilage damage after steroid injection but no definitive evidence. Systematic Reviews (Stevens et al and Douglas 2012) have both concluded similarly, the frequency of injections should be guided by clinical diagnosis, treatment aims, professional opinion and experience. \nUpToDate provides more recent evidence (Oct 2018) advising against serial steroid injections due to concerns about potential negative effects on cartilage and disease progression; no number is cited as being safe of unsafe.\n\n<b>Menstrual Irregularity & Cushing\u2019s Syndrome</b>\nSystemic absorption of steroid has been shown to affect the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after steroid joint injections. This can last up to four weeks after a single injection, occasionally longer, depending on the dose and frequency of injections. \nThis is the mechanism thought to affect menstruation.   Rare cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported but generally using unusually high doses and frequencies. HIV patients on antiretrovirals are more susceptible to iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Careful consideration should be given to this complication if multiple or repeat steroid injections are going to be undertaken. \n\n<b>Soft tissue atrophy</b>\nThis is an uncommon complication of steroid injection even in superficial dermatological procedures involving steroid injection.\nHyperglycaemia \u2013 Intra-articular steroid injections have been shown to elevate blood sugar in diabetic patients, starting after a few hours and lasting for several days, sometimes longer. These increases in glycaemia are statistically significant but for most patients not clinically significant. However, diabetic patients should be warned of this effect. \n\n<b>Anaphylaxis</b>\nAccording to the resuscitation council UK website, the time course for cardiopulmonary arrest resulting from injected medication predominantly occurs between 2- 20 minutes post injection. Patients should be asked to stay for the full 20 minutes.  \n</p>",

                "Presentation": "<p>Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoan of the genus <i>Leishmania</i> [1]. The presentation of Leishmaniasis varies according to the species causing the infection and the region in the world where a person is infected. \n\nThere are 3 main types of Leishmaniasis [2,3]:\n    - Visceral (Kala-Azar).\n    - Cutaneous.\n    - Mucocutaneous.\n\nThis section will focus on cutaneous Leishmaniasis since this is the type that is mainly present in Panama [2]. \n\nLesions start mostly on exposed regions of the skin which are easily bitten by sandflies. The lesions start as erythematous patches that change to plaques and ulcers. Unless there is a secondary bacterial infection, the lesions are usually painless. Many patients have limited cutaneous lesions that self-cure within 6-18 months, leaving scarred tissue.\n\n<i>Leishmania Viannia Panamensis</i> in one of the species present in Panama. Any <i>Leishmania</i> species in the <i>Viannia</i> subgenus can cause Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL). Sometimes this occurs years after an initial cutaneous infection. \n\nThankfully, MCL is not common in the region but patients presenting with nasal congestion or chronic upper airway symptoms may in fact have MCL. Check for nasal septum lesions and/or refer to ENT.</p>",
                "Causes": "<p>\u2018Scattered cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis occur in rural areas in the entire country, but most cases are reported from western Panama (Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui and Panama Provinces) and from the west-central areas [4].\u2019\n\n<i>L. (v) Panamensis</i> is responsible for the great majority of the cases, mostly in forested areas from west to east, including Bocas del Toro [5]. \n\nThe two-toed sloth is the main reservoir [5,6].</p>",

It is advised that any case of Leishmaniasis from a species in the <i>Viannia</i> subgenus should receive systemic treatment, due to the future risk of conversion to MCL.\n\n[9]</p>",
                "Complications": "<p>The cutaneous form differs from the visceral variety and doesn\u2019t transform to Visceral Leishmaniasis (except in rare cases of immunocompromise in HIV). \n\nIn certain regions of Central and South America with the <i>Vianna</i> subgenus, 5% of the cutaneous form may develop into Mucocutaneous form (sometimes years after the initial infection), which typically affects the nasal mucosa and is destructive in nature. \n\nHowever, in our region of Panama this seems to be very rare, but we need to be vigilant. [10]. \n\nOther potential complications of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis include [10,11]:\n\nBleeding, superimposed infections due to immunodeficiency and disfigurement.</p>",

            "Presentation": "<p>Patients' knowledge of wound care is generally poor in this area. Initially assess the wound and the need for closure. \n\nAssess [1,2,3] the mode of injury, time of injury, type of wound, location (proximity to major vessels and nerves), shape of the wound, depth and direction. \n\nAlso check to for the presence of a potential foreign body and for underlying structural injury.\n\nThe next step is to achieve haemostasis [4]. This can be spontaneous but may require pressure or elevation. Do not use a tourniquet.[4,5]\n\n</p>",
            "Cleaning and Suturing": "<p>Please be aware of the fact that often the patient will be in a lot of pain! Analgesia is sometimes needed.\n\nUse lidocaine up to 3 mg/kg. NB: a 1% solution contains 10 mg/mL. [4,5]\n\n<b>Wound Closure</b>\nThe timing of wound closure will be based on your assessment of the wound [6,7]:\n\nPrimary Closure: \nImmediate closure can be used for simple wounds under 12 hours old with opposable edges. \n\nDelayed Primary Closure: \nIf there is high risk of infection. \nGive prophylactic antibiotics and close after a few days. \nThis is something that can be done on a follow up.\n\nSecondary Closure: \nAllow the wound to close by itself if a bite (except on the face) or it has separated edges or infection. \nThis may result in increased scarring.\n\n<b>Type of Closure</b> [6,7,8]\nIf primary closure is decided upon, generally we have 3 options available: steristrips, tissue adhesives and/or sutures. \nBear in mind that sutures will need to be removed. \nOften this can be problematic in our setting so if this option is chosen an appropriate removal plan is essential.\n\nSteristrips can be used for small wounds or to allow for drainage where needed.\n\nFor small superficial lacerations, consider the use of tissue adhesives [12] if available.\n\nIf sutures are used, advise regarding appropriate follow up. Teach patient or carer to remove sutures in a hygienic way if follow up is not possible. \n\nEnsure to consult with the LMP regarding follow up and management options. \n\nIn some clinic locations there are health workers who are trained to remove sutures. \n\nEnsuring that these health workers follow up the wound care after we're gone can be useful.\n\n</p>",
            "Dressings and Follow Up": "<p>Antibiotic cream is not advised for wound management, as it can slow healing.\n\n<b>Suture Removal</b> [2,4]\n-Face: 4 - 5 days\n-Neck: 7 days\n-Arms and back of hands: 7 days.\n-Scalp, chest, abdomen, back: 7-10 days.\n-Legs and top of feet: 10 days.\n-Palms, soles, fingers or toes: 12-14 days.\n-Overlying a joint: 12-14 days.\n\n<b>Contaminated wounds</b> \nDirty wounds and dog bites are best left open initially IF adequate follow up is likely to be available. \n\nHowever, if not:\n-Clean area well (sterile water/saline).\n-Remove debris and Irrigate the wound.\n-Close the wound and start antibiotics.\n-Clindamycin 150-300 mg 3x/day: 5-7 days. \n\n<b>Dressings</b> [11]\n\u201cThe first layer in contact with the wound surface should be non-adherent - eg, a lightly lubricated gauze with interstices.\n\nOcclusive dressings can lead to maceration with retained fluid.\n\nThe next layer should be absorbent material to attract any wound exudate.\n \nFinally, soft gauze rolls tape can be used to secure the initial materials in place.\n\nDressings may not be necessary if the wound is dry and extra protection is not required.\u201d\n[13,11].\n\nWhilst rabies is relatively rare, there have been some cases reported in Panama [12]. Patients with bat bites need rabies postexposure immunisation. \n\nFor all dirty wounds (e.g. animal bites or those involving metals), refer the patient to hospital for tetanus vaccination if the patient is not uptodate [13], the CDC recommends a booster every 10 years.</p>",
            "Education": "<p><b>Counselling</b>\nExplain clearly wound care highlighting the importance of:\n\n-Clean water/dressing.\n-Keeping wound dry.\n-Changing dressing if gets wet.\n-Daily review.\n-Counselling on poor healing/infection.</p>",

            "Presentation": "<p>Pulmonary TB is the commonest initial presentation, however it may also be extra-pulmonary; tuberculosis meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis etc.\n\nThe possibility of TB should be considered in any person with risk factors for TB exposure, who has suggestive symptoms. These include:\n-Chronic Fever.\n-Malaise.\n-Pleuritic chest pain.\n-Cough longer than 15 days.\n-Drenching Night sweats.\n-Weight loss.\n-Haemoptysis.\n-Clubbing.\n-Erythema nodosum.\n</p>",
            "Causes ": "<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary infection heals spontaneously in immunocompetent patients in 90% of cases.\n\nTuberculosis has been on the rise in Panama [1-3]. In 2005, 1,565 cases were reported (48.5 per 100,000 population). The areas at greatest risk are the provinces of Kuna Yala (210 per 100,000 population), Ng\u00f6be Bugl\u00e9 (152.6) and Bocas del Toro (107).\n\n[1]</p>",

            "Causes": "<p>There are numerous causes of seizures [2,3]. Seizures can be idiopathic (epilepsy), due to cerebrovascular disease, head injury, drug induced, due to metabolic disturbance amongst other factors.\n\nA particular cause to think about in our setting is central nervous system infection. Panama is known to have relatively high rates of Neurocysticercosis [126\u2013129] so consider this as a possibility.\n\nPseudoseizures should always be in the differential as they are not an uncommon presentation in any setting. </p>",
            "Diagnosis": "<p>Whilst history is crucially important for the diagnosis of a cause of a seizure, it is equally as important that reversible causes are ruled out. As such referral to hospital where blood tests and imaging can be performed is crucial.</p>",
            "Management": "<p>Identify any potential triggers for seizures and educate accordingly.\n\n<b>Potential Triggers</b>[2,3,4]\n-Sleep deprivation.\n-Medication non-adherence.\n-Alcohol (Excess or withdrawal). \n-Drugs.\n-Bright/Flashing lights.\n\nIf a patient is already established on medications, switching over to other ones can be extremely problematic if not monitored adequately. As such this should only be done by a specialist in our setting. \n\nIf you know a patient is on medication, we can re-supply it. Alternatively, Friday follow up can be utilised to acquire the necessary medication and then provide it to the patient.\n\nFor decisions on whether or not to commence new medications, it is usually best to refer onto a specialist. This is because anti-epileptic drugs will often require close monitoring when first initiated [4,5].\n\n<i>Carbamazepine.\nAdult; Initially 400\u202fmg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, increased until symptoms controlled; usual dose 400\u2013600\u202fmg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses; maximum 1.6\u202fg per day.\nChild 5\u201311 years; Initially 5\u202fmg/kg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, then increased in steps of 2.5\u20135\u202fmg/kg every 3\u20137\u202fdays as required, dose should be increased slowly; maintenance 10\u201315\u202fmg/kg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, increased if necessary up to 20\u202fmg/kg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses.\nChild 12\u201317 years; Initially 100\u2013400\u202fmg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, then increased to 400\u20131200\u202fmg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, increased if necessary up to 1.8\u202fg daily in 1\u20132 divided doses, dose should be increased slowly.</i> \n\n<b>Counselling on Contraception Methods for Women of Childbearing Age</b>\nAll women on carbamazepine should be offered contraception - including depo or referral for implanon/IUD/salpingectomy.\nIf a woman declines contraption despite counselling then 5mg folic acid should be given alongside carbamazepine (carbamazepine can be teratogenic but is less teratogenic than sodium valproate) and should be continued as long as she is not on definitive contraception.\n\nRegarding neurocysticercosis; Albendazole can treat the causative Taenia solium [2], it is generally recommended that this be done in a secondary care setting. This is because the killing of the cysticerci can initially worsen inflammation and cerebral oedema [5,6,7]. As a result, high dose concomitant steroid therapy may also be required.</p>",

                "Background": "<p>Up to 5 million snake bites annually with 94000 - 125000 deaths globally. \n\nDry bites (a bite where no venom is injected) occur in between 25% - 50% of snake bites, other literature shows even higher numbers of >50%. \n\nThe outcome of a venomous bite depends on snake species, amount of venom, location of the bite (head and neck are most dangerous), patient age/weight/fitness and time to receive medical attention.\n \nSnake bites are most common among people living in rural, resource-poor settings, who subsist on low-cost, non-mechanical farming and other field occupations. \n\nAgricultural workers, women and children are the groups most frequently bitten by snakes.\n \nPanama has the highest incidence of snake bites of Central America (2800 bites per year). \n\n<b>This region has two main types of snakes</b>\n\nNeurotoxic snakes in the region (coral snakes): neuromuscular blockage predominantly induced by post-synaptically acting low molecular mass neurotoxins which can lead to muscle paralysis.\n\nProteolytic venom snakes (fer de lance, known locally as 'dos equis.' and the bushmaster being the two most common) which cause tissue damage at the bite site.\n</p>",
                "Assessment": "<p>Symptoms: Depending  on the venom characteristics (neurotoxic, proteolytic etc.). \n\nPatient can have local effects like pain and tenderness, swelling, bleeding or blistering. Bleeding can be localized or diffuse. Some venoms can kill tissue around the site of the bite, and internal organs can be involved\n\nNervous systems effects: locally close to the bite area or affect nervous system directly (stopping breathing muscles). Initially victims may have vision problem, speaking and breathing problems and numbness close to or distant to the bite site.\n\nMuscle death: necrosis or rhabdomyolysis.\n\nEyes: direct eye pain and damage with venom in eyes.\n\nA rare complication in very swollen limbs is compartment syndrome.</p>",
                "First Aid for Snake Bites": "<p><b>First aid for snake bites</b>\nImmediately move away from the area where the bite occurred. If the snake is still attached use a stick or tool to make it let go. Sea snake victims need to be moved to dry land to avoid drowning.\n\nRemove anything tight from around the bitten part of the body (e.g.: rings, anklets, bracelets) as these can cause harm if swelling occurs.\n\nReassure the victim. Many snake bites are caused by non-venomous snakes. And even after most venomous snake bites the risk of death is not immediate.\n\nImmobilize the person completely. Splint the limb to keep it still. Use a makeshift stretcher to carry the person to a place where transport is available to take them to a health facility.\n\nNever use a tight arterial tourniquet.\n\nThe Australian Pressure Immobilization Bandage (PIB) Method is only recommended for bites by neurotoxic snakes that do not cause local swelling.\n\nApplying pressure at the bite site with a pressure pad may be suitable in some cases.\n\nAvoid traditional first aid methods, herbal medicines and other unproven or unsafe forms of first aid.\n\nTransport the person to a hospital.\n \n<b>Management before or during transport.</b>\nAt the time of a bite, the cornerstone of care is complete immobilization of the affected body part and prompt transfer to a medical facility. \n\nTourniquets and cutting wounds can worsen the effects of the venom and should not be used as first aid. \n\nAdditional measures include keeping bitten limb lower than heart, wound cleansing to decrease infection risk, supportive therapy such as airway support, and administration of tetanus vaccine upon discharge if the person has been adequately vaccinated against tetanus (WHO).\n \nImproving the clinical outcomes for the victims of snake bite needs much more than just access to safe antivenoms. Intravenous access should be achieved early, hydration state determined and corrected if needed, and vital signs must be closely monitored. Paracetamol may be given for local pain (which can be severe). \n\nVomiting may occur, so place the person on their left side in the recovery position. Closely monitor airway and breathing and be ready to resuscitate if necessary.\n \n<b>Contraindicated</b> .\nCutting into the bite site can damage underlying organs, increase the risk of infection, and sucking on the bite site does not result in venom removal.\n\nDo NOT use ice. Ice does not deactivate the venom and can cause frostbite.\n\nDo NOT use electric shocks. The shocks are not effective and could cause burns or electrical problems to the heart.\n\nDo NOT use alcohol. Alcohol may deaden the pain, but it also makes the local blood vessels bigger, which can increase venom absorption.\n\nDo NOT use tourniquets or constriction bands. These have not been proven effective, may cause increased tissue damage, and could cost the victim a limb.\n \n<b>Extra note</b>\nAntivenom can also cause serum sickness within 5-10 days of therapy. Serum sickness causes fevers, joint aches, itching, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, but it is not life-threatening.\n \nIn asymptomatic patients (bites without signs of envenomation and with normal coagulation), monitoring must continue for at least 12 hours , 24 hours preferred.\n</p>",
