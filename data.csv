$Introduction,,
General Guideline Principles,"The following guidelines have been written taking into account the local population and resources most readily available to our organization. 

Whenever possible, the guidelines should be followed as written. However, patients should always be treated individually. 

At times it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines: for individual patients or if specific resources are low. 

<b>All cases where the guidelines are not being followed must be discussed with the Lead Medical Provider supervising the clinic.</b>

As you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. 

The following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as, what is practically available and possible in our setting. Please regularly discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers (LMPs), who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. 

Even relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons. 

The Lead Medical Providers are there to ensure that the treatment each of our patients receives, meets Floating Doctors' standards. Treatment plans may differ between the communities also, depending on the local resources and closest healthcare facilities.
",
Prescriptions,"When prescribing medications please always ensure the patient is aware of the indication, name and dosage of every medication prescribed. This will allow them to inform doctors in the future, including at other health facilities. 

This can easily be done using our Floating Doctors prescription pads (placing a script in with each bag of medications). Please keep in mind not all patients are able to read. 

In the case of an illiterate patient we have special sheets with symbols, these can be found in our provider packs. A useful resource is family members - almost always there will be a family member living in the home who is able to read and help the patient with their treatment.
                                                                                                                               
If a patient is diagnosed with a chronic condition, requiring long-term medication, please fill in a Floating Doctors card for the patient. Details of the diagnosis, medication, blood pressure and blood sugar should be documented and the card given to the patient. The cards can be modified on future visits, depending on the treatment. The cards will allow the patient, and any doctor seeing the patient, to know what we are treating them for.
",
Medication Queries ,"For a list of all the medications we stock and prescribing information for each, please see the 'Essential Medications' section. We also have a hard copy of a 'Essential Medications' document available in clinic. This has information on all the medications we carry including the indications and dosage for each.

In clinic we also carry the British National Formulary (BNF) for adults and children. Please use the BNF for any medications queries not answered by the essential medications document. It is vital to check side effects and contraindications for all medications prescribed, particularly in children, pregnancy and breastfeeding.

In general we try and be much more conservative with prescribed treatments and only give them if absolutely necessary. 

A good example of this is the use of NSAIDs. We often have to ask volunteers to prescribe less NSAIDs because 1) we do not know if the patient has renal dysfunction 2) if the patient develops gastritis/peptic ulcer they often have very difficult access to healthcare 3) often paracetamol is sufficient and NSAID is not necessary. 

Risk benefit ratios of treatments can be different than in a provider's home country, our LMPs are there to help with prescribing decisions. Counselling patients on all possible side effects and risks is essential, as it is in all settings.   ",
,,
$Common Presentations,,
2.1 Fever,,
Presentation,"Usually present with subjective fever that can be taken as genuine in this setting.

Temperature > 38 Degrees Celsius.

Chills, rigors, sepsis.",
Causes,"Although the fever is frequently of viral origin, serious illness must be excluded [1]
    - Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection
    - Pneumonia.
    - Pyelonephritis.
    - Dengue.
    - Malaria (less likely).
    - Bacterial meningitis.
    - Skin infections.
    - Malignancy.
    - Vasculitis/Autoimmune disorders.",
Assessment,"A full assessment should be performed to identify the cause(s) of the fever. Multiple sources may be found so always do a full review.

<b>Full intake</b>
Including blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate.

<b>History</b>
Establish pattern and duration of fever.
Review of systems. 

<b>Examination</b>
Each organ system.

<b>For Children</b>
Check skin, throat and ears.
Ask about GI symptoms and seizures.
Urine dipstick test.",
Diagnosis,"Temperature >38 degrees Celsius.

Axillary temperature underestimates core body temperature by approximately 0.5 degrees Celsius. [2] 

0.5 degrees Celsius will be added to any axillary measurements at intake.",
General Management,"<b>Infants (aged 0-28 days)</b>
“All febrile neonates aged 0-28 days old should be hospitalized for presumed sepsis and treated with antibiotics pending culture results (48 hours).” [3, 4]

<b>Infants (aged 28-90 days)</b>
“All febrile infants aged 28-60 days, after having a sepsis evaluation, should be hospitalized and empirically started on intravenous antibiotics pending culture results.” [3]
Infants aged 28-90 days will require a number of investigations for which hospitalization is necessary. 
Regardless of hospitalization outcome, 
these children still require follow-up every 24 hours until the fever has resolved and all cultures are negative.5

<b>Infants (aged 3 months-3 years)</b>
“Febrile children aged 3 months to 3 years are evaluated, 
based on epidemiologic and focal findings revealed 
during the history taking and physical examination 
as well as whether or not these children are 
at low risk for serious bacterial infections [3,6].

Identification and appropriate management depends on the underlying cause. In the case of self-limiting viral infections, the only management required is advice and reassurance.

If meningococcal disease is suspected, give Ceftriaxone antibiotics at the earliest opportunity. 

<b>Health Education for patients and relatives</b>
Stress importance of adequate, and increased fluid intake.
Do not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets.
Don't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.
Cool baths and tepid sponging are not recommended.

<b>Antipyretic drugs</b>
Fever is the normal response of the body to infection and unless the child becomes distressed or symptomatic, fever alone should not be routinely treated.There is evidence that host defence mechanisms are enhanced by a raised temperature.
Antipyretics (eg, paracetamol and ibuprofen) should therefore not be used routinely but can be of value, especially for patients with systemic disease (particularly heart failure or respiratory failure) and when fever causes acute confusion.
Consider either paracetamol or ibuprofen as an option if a child appears distressed or is unwell.

Pharmacological Treatment (consult BNF or BNF for children)

First line: 
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen
Second line: 
Ibuprofen

** Please avoid maximum dosing where appropriate. Higher dosing is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment **


",
Treatment,"<b>Children</b>
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: 
15-20 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed. 

2nd line:
Ibuprofen.* 
1-2 months: 5 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed.
Over 2m: 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hrs as needed.

<i>Do not prescribe both together in children</i>

<i>*Do not prescribe in children with rash - due to a potentially severe reaction in chicken pox</i>

<b>Adults</b>
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen. 
500-100mg every 6-8 hrs as needed. 
(Maximum 4g/24 hours). 

2nd line: 
Ibuprofen 200-400 mg every 8hrs as needed.
",
Notes on NSAIDs,"Higher dosing of NSAIDs is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment.

Don't use Ibuprofen/aspirin in pregnant/breastfeeding women and avoid in those with peptic ulcer disease. 

Avoid Ibuprofen in children with fever and skin lesions, a rare adverse effect is worsening of skin lesions in chicken pox, which can be life-threatening. Paracetamol is the drug of choice.

2.2 Headache,,
Causes,"In our setting one of the most common causes is dehydration [1]. Awareness of this and advice to patients to increase oral intake is therefore vital.

Other causes include, but are not limited to [2]:

<b>Primary Headache</b>
Tension
Migraine
Cluster headache

<b>Secondary Headache</b>
The list of causes of secondary headaches is exhaustive and can be found elsewhere [1,3]. It is included but not limited to: meningitis, giant cell arteritis, sinusitis and visual problems.",
Assessment,"<b>History</b>
Establish patient’s normal fluid intake. 
Most of population drink only 1-3 glasses of water a day, often while working in the sun!

A good history is critical to the diagnosis and management of headache. Particular attention must be paid to red flags [4]:

<b>Red Flags</b>
- New onset headache.
- Onset after age 50 years.
- Change in pattern of headache.
- Worsening headache.
- Acute or sudden onset.
- Sudden onset during exertion/strain.
- Headache worse on lying down.
- In a patient with malignancy or HIV.
- With fever, night sweats, weight loss.
- Neurologic symptoms or signs.

<b>Exam</b>
Normal intake will be performed. 
Observe the patient walking and talking.
Examination specific to finds on history.
In case of red flags, ensure a full neurological exam is performed - including fundoscopy (to rule out papilloedema).
Any questions or concerns should be raised with the supervising LMP.",
Diagnosis,"Whilst access to investigations during Floating Doctors’ clinics will be somewhat limited, a simple history and examination will be ascertain the cause in most scenarios.

If any red flags or concerning features are elicited, please discuss with a Lead Medical Provider. Depending on the urgency of the situation, we can:

- Arrange an emergency hospital appointment.
- Expedite secondary care at a later date.",
2.2.1 Management,,
Dehydration/Tension Headaches,"Check lying and standing BP (if postural symptoms).

<b>Health Education</b>[5]
-Encourage ways to increase fluid intake. 
(i.e., coconuts, boiled water, soups, fruit).
-Explain importance of water in body.
-Advise reduction of caffeinated beverages.
-When urine is clear, they have drank enough water.
-Enquire about other triggers - i.e. stress.

<b>Pharmacological Treatment</b>
Paracetamol 500-1000mg as needed/6-8 hrs (max 4g/24hrs). 

<i>Advise only to take after they have drank 1 litre of water and if they still have the headache.</i>
",
Migraine,"<b>Health Education</b>
Advice about triggers (coffee/cheese/stress).
Encourage a symptom diary where the patient can recognize their triggers.

<b>Acute Migraine</b> 
Combination of an NSAID and an antiemetic (Ibuprofen 200 - 400 mg and Metoclopramide 10mg).

<b>Chronic Migraine</b>
Regular prophylactic medication can be considered if the patient is having more than 2 migraines per month[5,6,7]. 

First line: 
Atenolol 50 mg once a day.*

Second line: 
Amitriptyline 12.5mg at night, 
Increase to 25 mg if tolerated.

*<i>Always assess for contraindications to B-blockers (asthma, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease or depression.</i>
",
Other Causes,"Other causes of headache can include: 

- Sinusitis.
- Neck pathology.
- Dental pathology.
- Otitis media. 
- Dengue (in outbreak).
- Malaria (if travel)

Headache with red flags:  

- Space occupying lesions.
- Intracranial bleeds.
- Intracranial infections.
- Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Any concerns that the headache is not just a simple tension or dehydration headache, ensure a full neurological examination including fundoscopy, in a dark room, is performed (to rule out papilloedema).

2.3 Musculoskeletal Pain,,
Causes,"“Musculoskeletal pain is a well known consequence of repetitive strain, overuse, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. 

These injuries include a variety of disorders that cause pain in bones, joints, muscles, or surrounding structures. 

The pain can be acute or chronic, focal or diffuse. Low back pain is the most common example of chronic musculoskeletal pain. 

Other examples include tendonitis and tendinosis, neuropathies, myalgia, and stress fractures [1].”",
Presentation,"Many patients describe a long history of generalized muscular pain, worse after work.

Knee pain tends to be due to osteoarthritis.

Back pain tends to be due to poor posture, particularly when lifting heavy objects.

Shoulder and elbow pain tends to be from repetitive use (with machete or washing clothes).",
Assessment,"<b>History</b>
A thorough history can often elucidate a likely cause. Exclude history of direct trauma, deformity, or acute pathology (ongoing infection/ septic joint).
For back pain, pay particular attention to red flag features [1,2]:

<b>Red Flags</b>
-Thoracic pain
-Age of onset  <20 or >50 years). 
-Loss of bowel or bladder control.
-Weakness/numbness in limb(s).
-Foot drop, disturbed gait.
-Associated fever.
-Saddle anaesthesia. 
-History of carcinoma/Tuberculosis.
-Structural deformity.

<b>Examination</b>
Depending on the affected joint, it is necessary to perform a focused examination to guide management and follow up.

If back pain is associated with bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anaesthesia, a perform a digital rectal examination [3]. 

<b>A full neurological exam must be performed in any patient with one or more red flags.</b>

<b>If any alarming signs are elicited, hospital evaluation can be facilitated.</b>
",
2.3.1 Management,,
Health Education,"Give appropriate exercises and stretches.

Physiotherapy can be extremely beneficial.

Heat packs made with a cloth and warm water.

Advice on posture, moving, and handling techniques.

Reassurance that muscular pain is normal after hard work and it tends to subside with time. 

Advise them to return to next clinic or seek further medical advice if needed.

Weight Loss where appropriate (overweight with osteoarthritis in lower limb joints).",
Acute Musculoskeletal Pain,"Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: 
500-1000mg as needed/6-8 hrs. 
(4g/24hrs maximum).

<b>Acute Inflammation & No Contraindications</b>
Ibuprofen 200-400mg, 3x/day as needed. 

*<i>Not for repeat prescriptions, see side effects and contraindications of NSAIDs.</i>",
Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain,"Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: 
500-1000mg, as needed/6-8hrs. 
(max4g/24hrs).

Also see section on joint injections if appropriate.

<i>NSAIDs not indicated, likely to cause more harm long term</i>",
Neuropathic Pain,"This could be diabetic neuropathy or a condition such as sciatica.

Amitriptyline 12.5 mg at night, increased after a week to 25mg.",

2.4 Intra-Articular Injections,,
Indications,"- Arthritis.
- Bursitis.
- Tendinopathy.
- Tenosynovitis.
- Enthesopathy.",
Potential Complications,"- Hypersensitivity (local/systemic).
- Tissue atrophy or nodule formation.
- Skin hypopigmentation.
- Tendon Rupture.
- Infection, local or systemic.
- Post-Inj. flare of symptoms (upto 48 hrs).
- Facial flushing (usually after 24-72hrs). 
- Menstrual irregularity.
- Elevated blood sugar in diabetic patients.
- Fainting/vasovagal reaction.
- Steroid induced osteonecrosis/arthropathy.
",
Contraindications,"- Known allergy.
- Local or systemic infection.
- Active skin lesion over site of infection.
- Uncontrolled coagulopathy.
- Fracture/unstable joint.
- Tendon Region at high risk of rupture.
- Prosthetic Joint.
",
General Approach,"Informed consent (below) - the most is to important report signs of infection urgently.

Screen for any contraindications. 

Draw up local anaesthetic and steroid and discard needle.

Attach new sterile needle.

Mark site (e.g. using needle cover). N.b. Injecting through ink risks tattooing skin.

Clean area with appropriate topical antiseptic.

Aspirate pre-injection to ensure vessel not entered.

Inject using no touch technique (unless full sterility observed).

Cover site with sterile dressing.

The patients should be advised to remain in clinic for 20 minutes post injection.

Relative rest for 24 to 48 hours post injection, particularly if the knee is injected.

Review patient at 24 – 48 hours.

Warn patient about steroid flare of symptoms (usually short lived up to 48 hrs) & advise patient it may be up to 5 days before benefit noted.
",
Use of Local Anaesthetic,"Immediate relief from the anaesthetic as evidence of good placement of the injection.

Decrease the propensity of the glucocorticoid to cause atrophy.

Decrease glucocorticoid crystals acting as irritant or pro-inflammatory factor (so-called post injection flare) before the biochemical effect of the glucocorticoid takes over.
",
Consent,"The patient should be informed about the relevant risks and benefits of the injection. 

The clinician should document that such a discussion has taken place and that the patient has consented to the treatment.",
Complications,"<b>Infection Risks</b>
A rare complication of joint and soft tissue injection.  Hand mediated transmission is the major factor contributing to healthcare associated infection. Patient skin preparation is recommended prior to surgical procedures to reduce risk of infection.  However, the absence of skin prep in clinic should not be considered an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a joint injection. 
Before skin preparation, the skin should be free of visible dirt. The skin preparation should be applied in concentrically enlarging circles beginning at the site of proposed injection. Alcohol based, chlorhexidine based and iodine based preparation are all suitable.

<b>Tendon Rupture</b>
There have been case reports of tendon rupture following steroid injection and ingestion. Biopsy studies have demonstrated reduced cell viability and proliferation, reduced collagen synthesis and organisation, and reduced strength as a result of tendon exposure to steroid. Therefore, it is generally best to avoid injecting steroid into the body of a tendon and, unless strongly indicated, avoid steroid injections in the vicinity of tendons at high risk of rupture due to pathology (severe tendinopathy) or anatomical location (Achilles).

<b>Osteonecrosis</b>
The risk of osteonecrosis is highest with prolonged, high doses of exogenous steroids, particularly in the presence of other risk factors. Short courses of steroids however have also been shown to increase the risk of this rare complication.

<b>Anticoagulation and joint injection</b>
If the INR <4.5 then it is generally considered safe to proceed as bleeding risks are very low. However, it is unlikely the patient will have had a recent INR so you may need to refer the patient to a specialist or for an INR or consider other treatment options. Analgesia options are often limited in these patients. 
The decision to do these injections in patients who are anti-coagulated requires careful consideration. The risk of halting anticoagulation is often higher than the small risk of bleeding complications, but this should always be weighed. A management plan in the event of bleeding should be discussed with the patient in advance. We have few patients receiving warfarin treatment.

<b>Steroid Type and Frequency</b>
Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone are the two injectable steroids commonly available to Floating Doctors. There have been some suggestion of cartilage damage after steroid injection but no definitive evidence. Systematic Reviews (Stevens et al and Douglas 2012) have both concluded similarly, the frequency of injections should be guided by clinical diagnosis, treatment aims, professional opinion and experience. 
UpToDate provides more recent evidence (Oct 2018) advising against serial steroid injections due to concerns about potential negative effects on cartilage and disease progression; no number is cited as being safe of unsafe.

<b>Menstrual Irregularity & Cushing’s Syndrome</b>
Systemic absorption of steroid has been shown to affect the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after steroid joint injections. This can last up to four weeks after a single injection, occasionally longer, depending on the dose and frequency of injections. 
This is the mechanism thought to affect menstruation.   Rare cases of Cushing’s syndrome have been reported but generally using unusually high doses and frequencies. HIV patients on antiretrovirals are more susceptible to iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. Careful consideration should be given to this complication if multiple or repeat steroid injections are going to be undertaken. 

<b>Soft tissue atrophy</b>
This is an uncommon complication of steroid injection even in superficial dermatological procedures involving steroid injection.
Hyperglycaemia – Intra-articular steroid injections have been shown to elevate blood sugar in diabetic patients, starting after a few hours and lasting for several days, sometimes longer. These increases in glycaemia are statistically significant but for most patients not clinically significant. However, diabetic patients should be warned of this effect. 

<b>Anaphylaxis</b>
According to the resuscitation council UK website, the time course for cardiopulmonary arrest resulting from injected medication predominantly occurs between 2- 20 minutes post injection. Patients should be asked to stay for the full 20 minutes.

2.5 Rash,,
Presentation,"Patients, typically children, present with acute or chronic rashes. 

Often these are nonspecific and the underlying diagnosis can seem unclear.",
Causes,"<b>Common Causes</b>
- Scabies.
- Impetigo.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis.
- Folliculitis.
- Insect bites.
- Cutaneous leishmaniasis.

It is important to be aware that skin rash can be due to more sinister causes [1]. These include meningococcal disease, malignancy, non-accidental injury or TB.",
Assessment,"Children in the communities are usually fully vaccinated, and often the mothers will have a card to prove it. Thankfully this makes a lot of the more serious infections less likely. 

If you are in doubt regarding vaccinations as the mother forgot the child's card, ask the Lead Medical Provider if the community in question has a good vaccine program (some communities have less access than others unfortunately).

<b>History</b> [2]
-Past medical and family history, 
-Occupation, hobbies, Medications.
-Duration of lesions.
-Have there been previous episodes?
-Does the lesion persist or change?
-Where is/are the lesion(s)?
-Provoking or relieving factors?
-Itch, tenderness, bleeding or discharge.
-Has patient previously received treatment?
-Joint/eye Involvement?
-Fever?

<b>Examination</b>
-Do a thorough examination. 
-If required, consider using the private room.
-Check mucous membranes.
-Undressed children for full exam.

Wounds/Secondary Infections,"Clean the wound with clean water and soap and iodine.

Counsel the Patient regarding maintaining the wound and avoiding the ocean.

Do not use triple antibiotic cream (unless impetigo), supply iodine to the patient to take home with counselling on how to use.

If the infection needs antibiotic treatment, give antibiotics as per cellulitis or impetigo guidelines depending on the clinical presentation.",
Follow up,"To see if the started treatment is effective you can ask the patient to return to the Friday Follow-Up on single-day clinics (or Thursday morning on multi-day clinics). 

Special therapies may be acquired and brought back during Follow-Up if they aren't ones we stock regularly.",

General Principles in Children,"General Principles for Diarrhoea and Dehydration in infants/children [2-4]. Tell carer to...

<b>Give extra fluids</b>
More frequent breastfeeds for a longer duration.

If not exclusively breastfeeding or not taking the breast give ORS 10 ml/kg/hr or food with liquid content.

After each loose stool give extra fluid.

Up to 2 years: 50 to 100 ml after each loose stool.

2 years or more: 100 to 200 ml after each loose stool.

<b>Continue feeding</b>
Never stop feeding, good foods include banana, cereals, bread: avoid sugary foods.

<b>Seek medical attention if...</b>
-Dry mouth/lips.
-Lack of tears.
-Not keeping any fluid down.
-Not making urine/Dry nappies. 
-Lethargic/confused.



",dehydration_management
Moderate Dehydration,"If a child looks moderately dehydrated or you have any concerns... 

<b>Discuss with the LMP</b>

Give ORS in clinic and observe closely over 4 hours.

If not improving, then consider IV fluids or hospital admission. Ideally review patient again in 24 hours.

If diarrhoea:
Give Zinc supplements OD 10 days (2 - 6 months: 10mg, 6 months–5 years: 20mg). 

<i>Zinc decreases the length of diarrhoeal illness and decreases the recurrence of diarrhoeal illnesses.</i>[5]

Determine the amount of ORS to give in the first 4 hours [6] (20 ml/kg per hour)
(View picture above)

Depending on your level of concern, the options are:

-Give IV fluids in clinic.
-Arrange transfer and admission.
-Arrange Friday Follow-Up.
",
Rehydration Options,"ORS is best, or (clean) water, avoid sugary drinks. ORS is routinely available in clinics. 

A home remedy can be taught for the next time the patient has diarrhoea and/or dehydration.

Sugar Salt Solution (Home remedy) [5-7]
    - IL clean water (boiled)
    - ½ tsp salt
    - 6 tsp sugar

Alternatives: Coconut water, Rice water.",

$Malnutrition,,
Growth Assessment,"A height and weight measurement for all children should be performed at all clinic visits. If either of these are abnormal, please recheck all of the following:

-Child’s date of birth.
-Calculated age.
-Height/length measurement.*
-Weight.** 
-Graph plotting.*** 

*<i>Ideally with measure board.</i>
**<i>Minimal clothes, weigh with mother</i>
***<i>Always use a ruler.</i>

If a child is premature the corrected age should charted until 2 years. (e.g. if born at 34 weeks, at 6 weeks of life their weight is plotted at day 0).

If any of the above are done incorrectly then the child’s growth chart will be incorrect.

Laminated Z-scores available in clinic.

<i>Use electronic scales, they must be calibrated before each clinic.</i>",
Growth in Babies,"In the first week of life babies can lose up to 10% of their birth weight. This is normal. They should regain their birth weight by 2 weeks of age. 

If a baby loses more than 10% of its birth weight this is concerning and they should be referred urgently to hospital for review. Beyond 2 weeks of life, healthy babies should gain around 150-200 grams per week until age 6 months.

Concerns regarding the growth of a baby under 6 months (weight loss/failure to thrive/low z-score) should lead to an urgent referral to a paediatrician, there is more likely to be an organic cause.",
Oedema,"Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) can present with varying levels of oedema. The retained fluid will make the weight of the child higher and z-scores/MUACs unreliable. 

<b>Oedema in a child is always a red flag</b>
Children with oedema should be immediately taken to hospital.",
Causes of Malnutrition,"The underlying cause of a child’s malnutrition can be complicated and difficult to determine. Commonly it is a combination of any of the following, and they should all be considered.

Low birth weight due to intrauterine factors.

Insufficient nutrient intake; including insufficient breast feeding, late weaning and lack of household food due to
poverty.

Infections; Including diarrhoeal disease, GI worms, pneumonia.

Underlying medical conditions; Including cardiac disease, endocrine disorders, respiratory disease.",
Z-Score Tables,"Z-scores are the standard deviation from the mean in a normal distribution.

The tables above are WHO Z-score tables, to be used for all children Globally, no matter which community they are from. 

Weight for Length/Height (WfL) - To assess wasting.

Length/Height for Age (LfA) - To assess Stunting.

Weight for Age (WfA) - To assess underweight.
","weight_height_boys, weight_height_girls, length_boys, length_girls, weight_boys, weight_girls"
Clinical Assessment,"All children with any degree of malnutrition should have a full assessment of the following and an LMP always needs to be involved in their care:

<b>History</b>
Weight loss.
Recent or recurrent illness (fever, diarrhoea, LRTI).
Review of systems.
Family history/health of other children in the house.
Feeding appropriately/difficulties? Breastfeeding history.
Vaccination history.
Home circumstances.
Psychosocial wellbeing of the child.
Current and recent feeding habits.

<b>Physical exam</b>
All systems. 
Specifically screening for heart murmurs, pneumonia, abdominal tenderness, enlarged lymph nodes, organomegaly and clubbing.

<b>Investigations</b>
Haemoglobin, blood sugar, urine dipstick, HIV test if available.
",
Health Education,"<b>Breastfeeding counselling</b>
A huge issue in the region is that mothers exclusively breastfeed more than 6 months. 
WHO recommends weaning to begin at 6 months. 
Advise these mothers to feed the child before offering breastmilk and explain that after 6 months breast milk alone is not sufficient for her child. 
Some mothers also do not breastfeed their children for enough time in one go, meaning the infants do not receive the more nutrient rich milk, this should be advised against. 

<b>Feeding History</b>
Ask specifically what they have for each meal, snacks and how many bottles of milk/ amount of BF they have per day. 
Many children have their diet bulked out with large volumes of breast milk- this has far less nutritional value than a balanced meal and can cause severe anaemia and nutritional rickets due to vitamin D and calcium deficiency. 
Ask about sources of protein (coconut, beans, lentils, eggs, meat, fish). 

<b>Nutritional advice</b>
Ask what food is available in the house and if possible, advise a balanced diet based on what is available locally.

<b>If Diarrhoea</b>
Never stop feeding the child. 
Give extra food (in small and frequent meals) and extra clean water. 
Breastfeed more often.
Inform mothers that loose stool is common with malnourished children. 
If this is significant diarrhea and not just loose stools, then we will treat for Giardia.
Malnourished children get cold easily. 
Cover the child and keep it warm during night and especially during the morning hours.

3.1 Classification of Malnutrition,,
Summary of Classifications,"The classifications that follow are for children over 6 months. Concerns regarding the growth of a baby  under 6 months (weight loss/failure to thrive/low z-score) should lead to an urgent referral to a paediatrician, there is more likely to be an organic cause.

There are three ways in which malnutrition can present. In clinic, we need to be able to recognise each type so that we can treat the patient effectively but also prevent any worsening of mild cases.

<b>Wasting</b>
Low weight for length/height.

<b>Stunting</b>
Low length/height for age.

<b>Underweight</b>
Low weight for age.

<b>Obesity</b>
High weight for length/height.
 
Other:

<b>Failure to thrive</b>
This is not a classification of malnutrition but needs to be recognised and acted upon. Babies (under 6 months) who are not gaining adequate weight or children who are dropping centiles. This indicates energy requirements are exceeding energy intake and is usually due to an underlying disease process. If a clear easily treatable cause cannot be found, these children should be referred to a Paediatrician for investigation. 

More details about each in the following sections.",
Wasting,"Wasting is what is sometimes referred to as acute malnutrition. Severe wasting is sometimes also known as Severe Acute malnutrition (SAM). 

<b>MUAC and Z-Scores</b>
Check mid-upper-arm-circumference (MUAC) on all children 6 months to 5 years. It is a fast and reliable way of screening for and categorising wasting malnutrition. 
Check weight for length/height Z-Score (WfLz) for all infants under 6 months. 

At intake these measurements should be highlighted in the appropriate colour to bring the result to the attention of the provider.

WfLz can be used in children of all ages, it is preferentially used in children under 6 months and over 5 years (because the evidence for MUAC in this group is limited). 
It is another way of categorising and screening for wasting. It uses length/height and weight measurements to calculate the standard deviation of weight for length/height from the mean.

","wasting1, wasting2"
Stunting,"Stunting is the most common malnutrition presentation we see and it is not as benign as it may seem (see complications). Stunting relates to chronic/persistent malnutrition. 

Children under 2 years have the greatest capacity for catch up growth from stunting but all children should be treated for stunting when it is recognised. Stunting is a complex, intergenerational cycle. 

Length/Height for Age Z-Score (LfAz) should be used to categorise stunting (height around or below the 3rd centile).

Please see the diagram and table above.","stunting_cycle, stunting_table"
Underweight,"WfAz should be used to categorise underweight children (weight around or below the 3rd centile).

Check weight for age z-score (WfAz) if you are unsure of the categorisation from the centile (i.e. if the centile is close to the cut of you can check the weight on the chart).",underweight_table
Obesity,"Obesity is also a form of malnutrition. It is the second most common form of malnutrition we see after stunting. These patients lack micronutrients as they are not eating a balanced diet.  There are many long term consequences of obesity.

<b>Classification</b>
Overweight Weight for Length/Height (WfL) z-score between +2 and +3.

Obesity Weight for Length/Height (WfL) z-score +3 or over.",
3.2 Management,,
Mild Malnutrition,"These patients need to be screened for underlying medical conditions. If there is a likely underlying cause they should be referred to hospital urgently.

Otherwise they should be given the following treatment in clinic and reviewed next clinic or asked to take the child to the nearest Centro de Salud for monitoring on their weight in a month if appropriate.

<b>Albendazole</b> 
Over 6 months and under 10 kg: 200mg.
Over 6 months and Over 10kg: 400mg. 
Once a day on days 1 and 8.

<b>Multivitamin tablets</b>
1 per day until next clinic.

<b>Vitamin A supplementation</b>
(under 8kg: 100,000, over 8kg 200,000) once a day on days 1, 2 and 8 (do not give if the child has received in the last 4 months).
Only give if the parent has the child's vaccine card and Vitamin A has not been given.

<b>If Diarrhoea</b>
If chronic or recurrent diarrhoea give metronidazole 5 days for giardia treatment.

<b>Vaccinations</b>
If the child is not up-to-date with their vaccinations, they should be referred to the nearest clinic for the appropriate vaccinations. 

",
Moderate Malnutrition,"Children with a likely underlying medical cause, medical complications (infections/severe dehydration/severe anaemia) or children who fail an appetite test, should be referred to the hospital urgently for assessment.

In children under 6 months, the majority should be referred. Give good breastfeeding counselling.

Children with an appetite, who are 6 months to 5 years of age with an MUAC of 115 – 125 or a z-score of -2/-3 and who do not have any signs of medical complications or an underlying medical condition, should be given the following treatment in clinic. 

<b>Albendazole</b> 
Over 6 months and under 10 kg: 200mg.
Over 6 months and Over 10kg: 400mg. 
Once a day on days 1 and 8.

<b>Multivitamin tablets</b>
1 per day until next clinic.

<b>Vitamin A supplementation</b>
(under 8kg: 100,000, over 8kg 200,000) once a day on days 1,2 and 8 (do not give if the child has received in the last 4 months).

<b>If current or recurrent diarrhoea</b>
More than 3 episodes in 6 months
Give metronidazole 5 days for giardia treatment.
Give zinc sulphate 10 days.

<b>Vaccinations</b>
If the child is not up-to-date with their vaccinations, they should be referred to the nearest clinic for the appropriate vaccinations. 

<b>Mannapack Rice</b>
For moderate wasting in uder 5 year olds and severe stunting in under 2 year olds give a supply of Mannapack Rice as per the table below. Parents should be told to prepare the rice for the day in the morning and give to the child in 8 separate sittings.

(Mannapack rice table)

All these children need a medical review in 2-4 weeks.

All parents need to be counselled that if the condition of the child deteriorates (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting, fever, increase in oedema), or if the child loses appetite, they should immediately take the child to nearest health facility.

Failure to improve significantly should result in a referral to the nearest hospital or refeeding centre depending on the clinical presentation.



",mannapack_rice_table
Severe Malnutrition,"<b>Severe Wasting</b>
Infants and children who are 6–59 months of age and have a mid-upper arm circumference <115 mm, have a z-score of -3 or less or who have any degree of bilateral oedema should be immediately referred to the nearest hospital.

These children require broad spectrum antibiotics due to immunocompromised. Amoxicillin for 5 days as per weight should be started before transfer to hospital.

Oral rehydration can be given with ORS if signs of moderate/severe dehydration, fluid balance can be difficult in children with severe malnutrition so proceed cautiously as to not fluid overload them reduce oral replacement by up to 50% depending on the child’s condition.

We refer all cases as we do not have the infrastructure to give the close follow up required, there are good refeeding centres in the region (Nutre Hogar), often it is inappropriate to manage these cases in the community without support for the family.

It can be very difficult to deal with cases where the family refuse to take the child to the hospital despite severe malnutrition. Usually this is due to mistrust of the local services and fear of leaving the community for a city far away. 

It should be made clear that Floating Doctors will support the family to travel to the hospital and if possible, attend hospital with them to help them navigate the health system and if needed support and advocate for them. If despite this, they refuse to take the child to the hospital we need to notify the health authorities urgently so they can assess the welfare of the child.

<b>Severe Stunting</b>
Theses cases should be given counselling, treatment and rice (as per moderate malnutrition) and referred directly to a paediatrician to rule out an underlying medical cause.

<b>Severe Underweight</b>
Check the WfH z-score. Is the child underweight because they are stunted or wasted or both? If severe wasted they need to be referred immediately. Otherwise, it may be appropriate to give counselling, treatment and Manna rice (as per moderate malnutrition) with a follow up in 1 month with the centro de salud.",
Social Support,"Ask family if they are recieving Red de Opertundades and Senapan (food stamps).
If there is a family with stunted or malnurished children who are not receiving both benefits, you must take all the details and discuss with the Floating LMP.
We will liase with social services so that the family recieves the support they are entitled to.",
$Dermatology,,
5.1 Parasitic Skin infections,,
5.1.1 Scabies,,
Presentation,"Relatively common in the communities we visit. The most common symptoms of scabies, itching and a skin rash, are caused by sensitization (a type of “allergic” reaction) to the proteins and feces of the parasite. 

Severe itching (pruritus), especially at night, is the earliest and most common symptom of scabies. 

A pimple-like (papular) itchy (pruritic) “scabies rash” is also common. In this climate itching and rash may affect the whole body or be limited to common sites (between the fingers, wrist,elbow, armpit and penis). [1]",
Causes,"Scabies is an itchy rash caused by the parasitic mite <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> [2].

Risk Factors are overcrowding, poverty, poor nutritional status, poor hygiene, children, immunocompromised individuals and elderly [3]. The elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are at particular risk of the crusted variant (Norwegian Scabies). 

They tend to present with clinically atypical lesions and are often misdiagnosed, causing a delay in appropriate treatment and increased risk of a local epidemic.

",
Assessment,"The diagnosis is largely clinical. A magnifying lens may help in identification of burrows or even occasionally mites [4]. If in doubt the case can be posted with images on SERMO.

Skin scraping can be taken for evaluation under the microscope for definitive diagnosis.",
Management,"Treat whole family, where possible, wash bedding, hammocks and clothes in very hot water and leave to try in direct sunlight.

Soap and counselling on good hygiene.

The primary  method of treatment for scabies is by either oral anthelmintic (ivermectin), or topical application of a parasiticidal preparation (permethrin) overnight to the whole body from head to toe. 

Which agent to use is dependant on the weight of the patient, if the patient is pregnant or if the patient is breast feeding. 

Treatment is should be repeated a week later. If there is secondary bacterial infection present, this should be treated first with antibiotics for 24-48 hours in the case of permethrin to avoid systemic absorption.

<b>Under 15kg, Pregnant/Breastfeeding</b>*
Permethrin cream 5%**
-Apply to body on day 1 and day 8.
-Apply at night
-Avoid face.
-Mittens to avoid ingestion in infants. 
-Don't apply to broken/inflamed skin. 
-Treat bacterial infections first with for 24-48hrs.

Do not apply after a hot bath; increases systemic absorption and removes the drug from its treatment site. 

*<i>Ivermectin contraindicated in all three.</i>
**<i>Children over 2 months.</i>

<b>Over 15kg</b>
Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg once, day 1 and day 8.

<b>Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies</b>
-Ivermectin 200 mcg/Kg (if safe)      AND
-Permethrin 5% cream .
-Patients are often immunocompromised.
-Consider Malnutrition, HIV etc.

<i>May require two or three applications of permethrin on consecutive days to ensure that enough penetrates the hyperkeratotic areas to kill all the mites.</i>

[4,5]

",ivermectin_dosing_table
Complications,"Secondary bacterial infection. Cellulitis, impetigo and abscesses may be the result, and bacterial skin infection can further predispose to invasive infection and sepsis.

Scabies can cause flaring or reactivation of eczema or psoriasis. Those whose immunity is highly sensitive can present with extensive dermatitis or even erythroderma.

Scabies has social stigma and may cause psychological harm with persistent delusions of parasitosis, shame or guilt. [4,5,6].",

5.1.3 Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,,
Presentation,"Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoan of the genus <i>Leishmania</i> [1]. The presentation of Leishmaniasis varies according to the species causing the infection and the region in the world where a person is infected. 

There are 3 main types of Leishmaniasis [2,3]:
    - Visceral (Kala-Azar).
    - Cutaneous.
    - Mucocutaneous.

This section will focus on cutaneous Leishmaniasis since this is the type that is mainly present in Panama [2]. 

Lesions start mostly on exposed regions of the skin which are easily bitten by sandflies. The lesions start as erythematous patches that change to plaques and ulcers. Unless there is a secondary bacterial infection, the lesions are usually painless. Many patients have limited cutaneous lesions that self-cure within 6-18 months, leaving scarred tissue.

<i>Leishmania Viannia Panamensis</i> in one of the species present in Panama. Any <i>Leishmania</i> species in the <i>Viannia</i> subgenus can cause Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL). Sometimes this occurs years after an initial cutaneous infection. 

Thankfully, MCL is not common in the region but patients presenting with nasal congestion or chronic upper airway symptoms may in fact have MCL. Check for nasal septum lesions and/or refer to ENT.",
Causes,"‘Scattered cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis occur in rural areas in the entire country, but most cases are reported from western Panama (Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui and Panama Provinces) and from the west-central areas [4].’

<i>L. (v) Panamensis</i> is responsible for the great majority of the cases, mostly in forested areas from west to east, including Bocas del Toro [5]. 

The two-toed sloth is the main reservoir [5,6].",
Diagnosis,"In cases where Leishmaniasis is suspected, consult with a Lead Medical Provider.

The diagnosis and treatment of Leishmaniasis can be provided free of charge through MINSA. 

For the diagnosis of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, parasitological testing is required [7]. 

The number of cases of diagnosed Cutaneous Leishmaniasis from 2009 is represented in the diagram above [8]:",cutaneous_diagnosis
Management,"<b>Consider the following</b>
-Number.
-Size.
-Evolution and persistence of lesions.
-Location of lesions (e.g. on the face).
-Other features ie lymphangitis.

<b>Medical Treatment</b>
Treatment often occurs in the closest Centro de Salud, based on clinical diagnosis and usually without monitoring of kidney or liver function. 

Standard treatment in Panama is 20 days of IM Pentavalent Antimony, which can cause reno-hepatotoxicity.

We treat any secondary infections in clinic and advice and support patients to seek treatment if there is a strong suspicion of leishmaniasis. It is advised that any case of Leishmaniasis from a species in the <i>Viannia</i> subgenus should receive systemic treatment, due to the future risk of conversion to MCL.

[9]",
Complications,"The cutaneous form differs from the visceral variety and doesn’t transform to Visceral Leishmaniasis (except in rare cases of immunocompromise in HIV). 

In certain regions of Central and South America with the <i>Vianna</i> subgenus, 5% of the cutaneous form may develop into Mucocutaneous form (sometimes years after the initial infection), which typically affects the nasal mucosa and is destructive in nature. 

However, in our region of Panama this seems to be very rare, but we need to be vigilant. [10]. 

Other potential complications of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis include [10,11]:

Bleeding, superimposed infections due to immunodeficiency and disfigurement.",

Non-bullous impetigo starts as tiny pustules or vesicles that evolve rapidly into crusted plaques that tend to be under 2 cm in diameter. 

It usually starts on the face or on the extremities where bites, scratches, burns or trauma have occurred. 

It spreads rapidly. Little or no surrounding erythema or oedema. Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged.

Bullous impetigo has a thin roof and tend to rupture spontaneously. They are usually on the face, trunk, extremities, buttocks, or perineal regions. More likely to occur on top of other disease like atopic eczema. [1]",
Causes,"<b>Impetigo</b>
In the UK Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism, Streptococcus pyogenes is the other pathogen involved, and on occasions both organisms can be found together. In warmer climates Streptococcus pyogenes is more prevalent.

<b>Bullous impetigo</b>
Is nearly always caused by Staphylococcus aureus. 

[2]",
Assessment,The diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical examination findings.,
Management,"<b>General Advice</b> [3,4,5,6]
“Advise good hygiene measures to prevent spread:

-Keep the affected area(s) clean and dry,
-Wash hands after touching affected area(s),
-Avoid sharing of towels and bathwater,
-Avoid scratching the affected area,
-Keep fingernails short and clean.” 
-Mittens for scratching children.

<b>Localised impetigo</b>
-Soap and water twice a day.
-Triple antibiotic cream 3x/day; 3-5 days.

*<i>Bacitracin or fusidic acid should be used in infants as Neomycin is contraindicated.</i>

5.3 Fungal Skin Infections,,
5.3.1 Dermatophytes,,
Presentation,"“Dermatophytosis (tinea) infections are fungal infections caused by dermatophytes. They tend to grow outwards on skin, producing a ring-like pattern - hence the term 'ringworm'. They are very common here in Panama and affect different parts of the body.”

According to site:
    - Scalp - tinea capitis.
    - Feet - tinea pedis.
    - Hands - tinea manuum.
    - Nail - tinea unguium (or onychomycosis).
    - Beard area - tinea barbae.
    - Groin - tinea cruris.
    - Body / trunk / arms - tinea corporis.

[1]
",
Causes,"Infection is limited to the dead layers of skin but encouraged by a damp and warm local environment like her in Panama. The infection can also be transmitted between people, from soil and from animals. [2]",
Differential Diagnosis,"Eczema and psoriasis are commonly confused with tinea. 

Pityriasis versicolor occurs over the trunk and candida occurs in the flexural surfaces at extremes of age, in the immunocompromised, those with diabetes or patients on antibiotics.

If in doubt, take a picture (with the patient’s consent) and post the case on SERMO. This opens up the clinical situation to a number of specialists. [3,4]
",
Management,"<b>Tinea Corporis</b>
1st line: 
-Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3 times a day. 
-Continue for 1-2 weeks after resolution.

-Under 12yrs: 10 mg/kg (max 500mg) 1x/day.
-Over 12yrs and Adults: 500mg 1x/day.

<b>Tinea Capitis</b>
-Shave head if appropriate.
-Clean with soap and water twice a day. 
-Examine family: ringworm is contagious. 
-Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3x/day     AND   
-Griseofulvin 4-6 weeks (dose as above).

<b>Tinea Pedis</b>
-Keep feet clean and dry as much as possible. 
-After each use of boots if used-
-If Severe: 
Clotrimazole 1% cream 2x/day: 4-6 weeks.

[5,6,7,8]
",
Complications,"The main complication is secondary bacterial infection.

Hair loss is a complication of tinea capitis. 

Tinea capitis can develop into kerion (boggy deeper scalp infection). [9]",

5.3.2 Candidiasis,,
Presentation,"Candidiasis often presents with soreness and itching.

Depending on the different forms of cutaneous candidiasis the appearance may vary:
-Red, moist skin area
-Possibly pustules or papules
-Yellow-white scale on the surface (looks like curds).

There are different forms of cutaneous candidiasis, the most frequent:
-Intertrigo (skin fold infection).
-Candida nail infections 
-Chronic paronychia or onychomycosis.
-Napkin dermatitis.
-Balanitis.
-Mucocutaneous candidiasis.
-Candida folliculitis.

[1]",
Causes,"The following factors increase the likelihood of candidiasis occurring [1,2]:
-Irritated or damaged skin.
-Patients taking antibiotics.
-Poorly controlled diabetes.
-Immunodeficiency e.g. HIV.
-Menopause.
-Pregnancy.",
Assessment,"In our clinical setting, access to investigations is limited. Diagnosis will be clinical based on the patient’s clinical presentation. If you are in doubt, liaise with a Lead Medical Provider. If you are still struggling consider adding the case to SERMO.",
Management,"<b>General measures</b> 
-Avoid occlusion of skin.
-Avoid obesity.
-Keep skin dry.
-Expose area to air when appropriate.
-Wash with emollients as soap substitutes.
-Dry thoroughly after washing.

<b>Pharmacological treatment</b>

<b>Candida Skin Infections</b>
-Clotrimazole 1% cream twice per day.
-Continue until 1 week after resolution.

10.3.3 Pityriasis Versicolor,,
Presentation,"A common yeast infection causing macular lesions and patches of altered pigmentation (usually hypopigmentation) are seen primarily on the trunk.

These lesions frequently spread to the neck, upper arms and abdomen and can sometimes occur at other sites. 

The face may be affected in children. 

There is a superficial scale which is best seen by stretching the affected skin, or scraping the surface. 

[1]",
Causes,"Relatively common in hot, humid climates. Pityriasis has an estimated prevalence around 30-40%. 

Most infections occur in normal healthy people but the following factors increase the risk:

-Hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating.
-Occlusive clothes, dressings or ointments.
-Immunosuppression or immune deficiency.
-Malnutrition.

[2]",
Assessment,"The diagnosis is most often clinical in our setting. The main differential is Pityriasis Alba, which is a post-inflammatory hypopigmentation.

It is best to take a good history of recent skin problems (infections/erythema/scaling). 

Consult with a Lead Medical Provider if in doubt. 

An alternative option is to post the case on SERMO should you be unsure. ",
Management,"First line: 
Clotrimazole 1% cream 2 times a day for 4 weeks.

*<i>If first line treatment fails, then review diagnosis and treat with second line if appropriate.</i>

Second line: 
Fluconazole 150mg once a week for 2-4 weeks (Adults).

<b>Health Education</b>
Do not share towels.
Wash clothes, sheets and towels in a hot wash.
Allow clothes to dry in direct sun.

10.4 Wound Care,,
Presentation,"Patients' knowledge of wound care is generally poor in this area. Initially assess the wound and the need for closure. 

Assess [1,2,3] the mode of injury, time of injury, type of wound, location (proximity to major vessels and nerves), shape of the wound, depth and direction. 

Also check to for the presence of a potential foreign body and for underlying structural injury.

The next step is to achieve haemostasis [4]. This can be spontaneous but may require pressure or elevation. Do not use a tourniquet.[4,5]

",
Cleaning and Suturing,"Please be aware of the fact that often the patient will be in a lot of pain! Analgesia is sometimes needed.

Use lidocaine up to 3 mg/kg. NB: a 1% solution contains 10 mg/mL. [4,5]

<b>Wound Closure</b>
The timing of wound closure will be based on your assessment of the wound [6,7]:

Primary Closure: 
Immediate closure can be used for simple wounds under 12 hours old with opposable edges. 

Delayed Primary Closure: 
If there is high risk of infection. 
Give prophylactic antibiotics and close after a few days. 
This is something that can be done on a follow up.

Secondary Closure: 
Allow the wound to close by itself if a bite (except on the face) or it has separated edges or infection. 
This may result in increased scarring.

<b>Type of Closure</b> [6,7,8]
If primary closure is decided upon, generally we have 3 options available: steristrips, tissue adhesives and/or sutures. 
Bear in mind that sutures will need to be removed. 
Often this can be problematic in our setting so if this option is chosen an appropriate removal plan is essential.

Steristrips can be used for small wounds or to allow for drainage where needed.

For small superficial lacerations, consider the use of tissue adhesives [12] if available.

If sutures are used, advise regarding appropriate follow up. Teach patient or carer to remove sutures in a hygienic way if follow up is not possible. 

Ensure to consult with the LMP regarding follow up and management options. 

In some clinic locations there are health workers who are trained to remove sutures. 

Ensuring that these health workers follow up the wound care after we're gone can be useful.

",
Dressings and Follow Up,"Antibiotic cream is not advised for wound management, as it can slow healing.

<b>Suture Removal</b> [2,4]
-Face: 4 - 5 days
-Neck: 7 days
-Arms and back of hands: 7 days.
-Scalp, chest, abdomen, back: 7-10 days.
-Legs and top of feet: 10 days.
-Palms, soles, fingers or toes: 12-14 days.
-Overlying a joint: 12-14 days.

<b>Contaminated wounds</b> 
Dirty wounds and dog bites are best left open initially IF adequate follow up is likely to be available. 

However, if not:
-Clean area well (sterile water/saline).
-Remove debris and Irrigate the wound.
-Close the wound and start antibiotics.
-Clindamycin 150-300 mg 3x/day: 5-7 days. 

<b>Dressings</b> [11]
“The first layer in contact with the wound surface should be non-adherent - eg, a lightly lubricated gauze with interstices.

Occlusive dressings can lead to maceration with retained fluid.

The next layer should be absorbent material to attract any wound exudate.
 
Finally, soft gauze rolls tape can be used to secure the initial materials in place.

Dressings may not be necessary if the wound is dry and extra protection is not required.”
[13,11].

Whilst rabies is relatively rare, there have been some cases reported in Panama [12]. Patients with bat bites need rabies postexposure immunisation. 

For all dirty wounds (e.g. animal bites or those involving metals), refer the patient to hospital for tetanus vaccination if the patient is not uptodate [13], the CDC recommends a booster every 10 years.",
Education,"<b>Counselling</b>
Explain clearly wound care highlighting the importance of:

-Clean water/dressing.
-Keeping wound dry.
-Changing dressing if gets wet.
-Daily review.
-Counselling on poor healing/infection.",

Reassure parents and advise to increase fluid intake.

Advise patients/ families about the usual course of the illness. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that the average total length of illness is 10 days.

Antibiotic treatment of URTI does not alter the outcome of the illness or prevent further complications [4]. Explain that antibiotics may also have side-effects - eg, diarrhoea, vomiting and rash.

Advise on hygiene measures.

We do not use cough remedies as there is no evidence of efficacy and some evidence of harm.

<b>Acute (sino) rhinitis</b>
Antibiotics are not effective for purely viral infections.

Reassure parents and advise to increase fluid intake.

Treat fever if distressing/symptomatic/over 38 degrees celsius.

<b>Specific to different types of pharyngitis</b>
Vesicular: blisters or ulcers on tonsils or pharynx. Always viral, usually coxsackie or herpes viruses.

Pseudomembranous: red throat with grey or white membrane over tonsils: consider diphtheria (check vaccination status). 

Patients over 14 years of age: GAS pharyngitis uncommon. 

Consider Infectious Mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr Virus in adolescents and young people with associated lethargy, adenopathy and splenomegaly. 

Pharyngitis in older age group can also be due to gonococcal infection or primary HIV infection (take a sexual history). 

Stridor is not usually a feature of isolated pharyngitis as it represents upper airway obstruction. In children consider croup or epiglottitis (especially in unvaccinated as causative organism is H. Influenza). 

GAS: more commonly have anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, palatal petechiae, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. Children may also present with a widespread rash and ‘strawberry’ tongue known as Scarlet fever.

-Dehydration (In children due to throat pain).
-Perform oral fluid challenge in clinic.
",
Treatment,"Treatment aims to provide symptomatic relief and prevent complications in those who are high risk. 

All patients should be advised to take regular paracetamol, adequate oral fluids and practice hand washing and infection control measures. 

Most cases of bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis will self-resolve in 7-10 days and the use of antibiotics is purely to reduce the risk of local complications and prevent subsequent rheumatic fever in children. 

In adults with bacterial features consider the use of a rapid test to guide whether or not to give antibiotics.

4.2 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection,,
Presentation,"The presentation of these conditions will depend on age, infecting organism and site of infection. Lower respiratory tract infection that may be viral or bacterial in origin. 

Presents with cough and difficulty breathing often associated with high fevers. Look for signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, and conscious state. 

Consider admission for any child under 2 months with pneumonia and those with features of severe illness.

Often it is appropriate to manage patients with pneumonia in the community, provided there are no signs of serious illness (such as sepsis), and there is an adequate follow-up plan. 
",
Causes ,"Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is infection below the level of the larynx and may be taken to include:
-Bronchiolitis.
-Pneumonia.
-Bronchitis.
-Infective exacerbation of COPD/Asthma.
-Tuberculosis.

[1]",
Assessment,"All patients should have the following measured:
-Respiratory rate.
-Heart rate.
-Oxygen saturations.
-Blood pressure.
-Temperature.

Chest X-rays are not routinely available but we can transfer patients for assessment or admission if required. 

Signs of severe pneumonia in adults include tachypnoea over 30 Breaths/Min, Hypotension, low pulse oximetry, cyanosis, confusion and patients over 65.

If a patient with COPD/Asthma has a suspected bacterial LRTI and does not have any focal chest signs (i.e. not pneumonia), then treat for an infective exacerbation of COPD/asthma. 

If the patient has focal chest signs and COPD then treat as severe pneumonia, covering suspected atypical organisms and treat wheeze with steroids and inhalers.",
4.2.1 Bronchiolitis,,
Presentation ,"Severe viral infection of the LRTI in children under 2 years.

The majority of cases caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and transmitted through droplet inhalation or contact with contaminated secretions.

Symptoms will worsen until day 4-5 until begin to resolve. [1,2] – it is important to warn the carer of this and to reassure them.

Most children are able to be managed at home with symptomatic treatment only, however hospital admission is indicated in cases of severe respiratory distress where oxygen and/or bronchodilators are required.",
Causes,"Most common cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

This is transmitted through droplet inhalation or contact with contaminated secretions. [3]",
Management,"<b>Health Education</b> [4]
Explain to the carer the timeline of the illness and reassure them.

Most children able to be manage at home with symptomatic treatment only.

Fluid intake, adequate nutrition and appropriate thermoregulation are vital. These should be discussed with the guardians.

<b>Indications for Admission</b> [5]
-Poor feeding: (Under 50% usual intake /24 hrs) inadequate for hydration.
-Lethargy.
-History of apnea.
-Respiratory rate over 70 breaths/minute.
-Nasal flaring or grunting.
-Severe chest wall recession.
-Cyanosis.
-Saturations under 94%.
-Uncertainty regarding diagnosis.
-Home care or rapid review not possible.

<b>Supportive Management</b>
-Increase oral fluids.
-Small, frequent feeds.
-Monitor for respiratory distress.
-Treat fever if distressing/symptomatic/>38C.

5.3 Asthma/COPD,,
Presentation,"<b>Asthma Risk Factors</b> [1, 2, 3]:
More than one of the following symptoms: 
-Wheeze.
-Breathlessness.
-Chest tightness.
-Cough

Symptoms particularly worse: 

-night/early morning.

-After exercise, allergens and cold air.

-After taking NSAIDs or B-blockers.

-History of atopic disorder.

-Family history of asthma and/or atopy. 

-Widespread wheeze.

Otherwise unexplained low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (historical or serial readings).

Otherwise unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia.

Frequently, an Asthma diagnosis is made on history and examination alone.  

Care must be taken with the differential diagnosis; in children wheezy bronchitis may be mistaken for asthma. In adults, COPD is the main alternative diagnosis. If tropical eosinophilia suspected, then a referral for a full blood count can be made.

For young children or those with difficulty using the inhaler, make a spacer with an empty water bottle. Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family
",
Assessment,"<b>History based on</b>
History of recurrent episodes (attacks) of symptoms, ideally corroborated by variable peak flow when symptomatic and asymptomatic.

Symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness that vary over time.

Recorded observation of wheeze heard by a healthcare professional.

Personal/ family history of other atopic conditions (particularly atopic eczema/ dermatitis, allergic rhinitis).

No symptoms/ signs to suggest alternative diagnoses.

<b>Exam</b>
Pay particular attention to pulse (which can be increased due to salbutamol use) and pattern of breathing.

Look for chest wall deformities

Peak Flow (simple and effective investigation that plays more of a role in the follow up of known asthmatics) [6,7]",
Diagnosis,"Not all asthma wheezes and all that wheezes is not asthma.'

<b>Differential diagnosis</b>[4]
In children wheezy bronchitis may be mistaken for asthma.

In adults, COPD is the main alternative diagnosis (ask about smoking and exposure to causative dusts).

Congestive cardiac failure with wheeze.

Allergy (Anaphylaxis, ABPA).

Chemical Pneumonitis.

Treat anyone presenting for the first time with a wheeze for potential tropical pulmonary eosinophilia with Albendazole [4]. This has the resultant effect of concomitant treatment of worms.",
Chronic Management,"<b>Inhalers</b>
1st line:  
Short acting beta agonist (SABA) as needed; 
Salbutamol 2 puffs as needed.

2nd line: 
Add in inhaled corticosteroid if poor control with SABA. 
Beclomethasone inhaler 
Over 12yrs: 1-2 puffs twice a day.
Under 12yrs: 4 puffs twice a day.

<b>Health Education</b>
Inhaler technique is often poor in the communities we visit. Spending time with the patients optimizing their inhaler technique can be extremely effective.

Consider making a spacer with an empty water bottle. Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family.

Advise patients about symptoms to watch out for and to seek medical advice should these develop [7]. Asthma can potentially be life threatening. Therefore it is vital that patients are adequately educated about the condition.

Ensure dietary calcium requirements are met if taking long term inhaled corticosteroids.

In adults, consider a trial of treatment with low dose inhaled corticosteroid and provide salbutamol for symptomatic relief. 

In severe cases, consider a short course of oral steroids and referral to hospital.

In children it is important to be wary of the potential side effects that may ensue from chronic steroid use. These must be balanced against the benefits that will result from treatment. If you have any queries or concerns, please consult a Lead Medical Provider.

[2]",
Acute Exacerbations ,"<b>Non-Infective Exacerbations</b>
Prednisolone (Adult; 30mg 1x/day); 5 days. 
Give a stat dose of ivermectin 200 mcg/kg in clinic if prescribing steroids to treat strongyloides before immunosuppressing patient.

<i>If increased sputum/change of sputum colour/fever then treat as infective exacerbation of COPD/Asthma.

3.4 Pulmonary Tuberculosis,,
Presentation,"Pulmonary TB is the commonest initial presentation, however it may also be extra-pulmonary; tuberculosis meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis etc.

The possibility of TB should be considered in any person with risk factors for TB exposure, who has suggestive symptoms. These include:
-Chronic Fever.
-Malaise.
-Pleuritic chest pain.
-Cough longer than 15 days.
-Drenching Night sweats.
-Weight loss.
-Haemoptysis.
-Clubbing.
-Erythema nodosum.
",
Causes ,"Pulmonary tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary infection heals spontaneously in immunocompetent patients in 90% of cases.

Tuberculosis has been on the rise in Panama [1-3]. In 2005, 1,565 cases were reported (48.5 per 100,000 population). The areas at greatest risk are the provinces of Kuna Yala (210 per 100,000 population), Ngöbe Buglé (152.6) and Bocas del Toro (107).

[1]",
Assessment,"<b>Always Ask</b>
-If HIV status is known.
-Details of known TB contacts.
-Any MDR TB contacts? (taking injectables?).
-Previous TB treatment details.*

*<i>When, how long, tablets or injectables. Completed treatment?</i>

An individualised plan should be made based on the patient’s location and clinical picture.

For Example: IF symptoms do not resolve with antibiotics then the patient needs to attend the local hospital.

In cases where Tuberculosis is suspected, discuss with the Clinic Manager and Lead Medical Provider as soon as you have a suspicion. Depending on the location of the patient, they can be investigated (and subsequently treated) for tuberculosis free of charge through MINSA (Ministerio de Salud).

Sometimes we support the patient with a referral to the nearest centre that can perform sputum testing and sometimes we transport the sputum ourselves.

",
Management,"<b>Presumptive Pulmonary TB cases in Clinic</b>
-Cough for over 15 days without other cause.
-Face masks given at earliest opportunity.
-Patient separated from other clinic patients.
-Staff to wear masks during consultation.
-Consultations in well ventilated area.
-Treat as bacterial pneumonia.
-Give patient 2 empty sputum containers.
-2 samples to be collected on follow up.

Anti-Tuberculous medications are commenced by MINSA. Our role at Floating Doctors is to act alongside the responsible health authorities. 

Often patients can develop other chest symptoms alongside their tuberculosis (COPD/Fibrosis/Bronchiectasis/Aspergilloma). These must be addressed where appropriate and not simply brushed under the umbrella term ‘tuberculosis’.",
Sputum Samples,"<b>Collecting Samples in Clinic</b>
-Label containers before giving to patient.
-Label: Name, community, DOB, Cedula.
-2 samples to be brought back to follow up. 
-Both morning samples taken 1 hr apart.
-We need sputum not saliva.
-Saliva only samples will be discarded.

<b>Receiving Samples</b>
-Receive wearing gloves and mask.
-Tightly fasten sputum container.
-place container in green biohazard bag.
-Place Biohazard bag in cool box.
-Refrigerate samples.
-Transfer to Bocas hospital 24-48hrs.

<b>Negative Test Results</b>
-Bocas performs ZN stains.
-2 negative AFB have 60-80% sensitivity. 
-Genexpert is much more sensitive (95%). 
-Gold standard is culture (upto 6 weeks).
-Culture is not performed often in the region.

<i>If a patient has a negative AFB smear and you still think TB is likely, the next step is to perform a Chest X Ray, or to refer the patient for further investigations.</i>

<b>Positive test results</b>
Patients with a positive test result (AFB/Molecular test/Culture) will be treated and followed up by the hospital. We will work with the hospital as requested to help notify the patient and organise their appointments with the hospital.

<i>Sometimes you may see patients who have been started on treatment based on an X Ray. This method of diagnosis is not sensitive and leads to high numbers of patients receiving treatment who do not need it. However, anyone started on treatment must complete treatment, even if the method of diagnosis was not ideal.</i> 

",
Complications,"<b>General</b>
-Weight loss.
-Severe anaemia.
-IRIS.
-Death.

<b>Pulmonary</b>
-Fibrosis.
-COPD.
-Aspergilloma*

*<i>Suspect in any patient with previous TB presenting with haemoptysis. Aspergilloma is a potential cause of massive haemoptysis.</i>

<b>Musculoskeletal</b>
Severe spinal deformities with Pott's disease, sometimes causing permanent paralysis.

Joint deformities, destruction and pain post treatment of TB joint infections.

<b>Cardiac</b>
-Pericarditis.
-Constrictive Pericarditis.
-Pericardial effusions.

$Gastrointestinal,,
Information,"Gastrointestinal illnesses are very commonly seen in clinic, particularly acute gastroenteritis and gastrointestinal helminth infections. 

Ascariasis, ancylostomiasis and trichuriasis are some of the most common soil-transmitted helminths in Panama. 

A big part of trying to prevent the number and severity of infections is to give health education alongside the prescribed medications. 

Advise patients to wash their hands after using the latrine and before eating, boil their water if they have no clean water supply, peel fruit and vegetables, and cook their meat thoroughly.",
4.1 Albendazole,,
Description,"We routinely give patients and their families one dose of Albendazole for helminths every 6 months. 

For children aged 1-2 years, a single 200mg tablet can be given, over 2 years 400mg. Albendazole should not be given to children under 6 months.

A single dose of albendazole can treat ascariasis, eosinophilic enterocolitis due to A. caninum, Trichostrongylosis, Hookworm (Necator or Ancylostoma).

For suspected cases of enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), i.e. if they see worms in their stool - advise patients to take another dose 2 weeks after the first one.
 
Although high priority should be accorded to the treatment of pregnant women, albendazole should not be administered during the first trimester. 

Give 400mg to women in the 2nd trimester and again in the 3rd trimester, as per WHO guidelines.

Adverse reactions: Transient gastrointestinal discomfort and headache have occasionally been reported. 

Always try to give the doses during clinic, so that we are present for any potential allergic reactions.",
4.2 Diarrhoea,,
Presentation,"Diarrhoea is the abnormal passage of loose or liquid stools more than three times daily and/or a volume of stool greater than 200 g/day [1]. 

Acute diarrhea is usually defined as that lasting less than four weeks and chronic diarrhea as that lasting more than four weeks. 

There are 2 clinical types, diarrhoea with blood (dysentery) and without (60% caused by viruses).

Common viruses causing diarrhoea are rotavirus (offensive smell), norovirus (vomiting), adenovirus. 

Common bacterial causes (most not needed antibiotics, and may worsen the diarrhoea or lead to more complications), E Coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella.",
Causes,"<b>Infectious Diarrhoea</b>
Eating raw, undercooked, unwashed, or improperly handled meat, poultry products, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, shellfish, and seafood.

4.4 Helminths (GI worms),,
Presentation,"Helminths are multicellular parasites with complex life cycles within and outside of human hosts. 

Patients can present themselves with symptoms of bloating, non specific abdominal pain, persistent/intermittent diarrhoea +/- nausea or vomiting. However patients are often asymptomatic.

Whipworm (trichuriasis) specifically can cause loose stools containing mucus and/or blood, nocturnal stooling and rectal prolapse in the setting of heavy infection. 

Roundworm (ascariasis) is associated with transient respiratory problems in the beginning of infection. While the most common symptom of pinworm (enterobiasis) is perianal itching (predominantly at night).

",
Causes,"Roundworm, hookworm and whipworm are some of the most common soil-transmitted helminths in Panama.

Autoinfection occurs by water, food or hands contaminated with soil. Person-to-person transmission can occur by eating food touched by contaminated hands or by handling contaminated cloths, bed linens or other environmental surfaces.

In addition, eggs (e.g. of pinworm) may become airborne, inhaled and swallowed. After ingestion eggs hatch and release larvae in the small intestine and the gastrointestinal tract and cause symptoms.

Hookworm is usually transmitted by larval penetration of the human skin. Therefore, preventative measures include wearing shoes.

[1, 2, 3,]",
Assessment,"<b>History</b>
-Diarrhoea.
-Visualisation of worms in stool.
-Rectal prolapse.
-Vomiting worms.
-Hygiene knowledge/practices.

<b>Examination</b>
-Abdominal palpation.
-Nutritional status.",
Diagnosis,"For persistent symptoms unresponsive to initial Albendazole treatment consider doing a stool examination. 

Eggs can be found when infected with i.e. roundworm and whipworm. 

The utility of stool examination is limited for pinworm since worms and eggs are not generally passed in the stool.

Certain infections can cause peripheral eosinophilia in blood examination.",
Management,"Albendazole every 6 months. 
6m-2yrs 200mg once.
2 yrs–Adults 400 mg once.

Patients will often have seen worms in the stool, but not always. 

Give 2 doses, separated by 2 weeks if a large worm burden is suspected (e.g. worms seen in stool, vomiting worms, anaemia or stunted growth).

In cases of anemia (with suspected hookworm infection); iron supplements can be given together with the treatment.

Consider treatment of whole household due to high transmission rates.

5.1 Urinary Tract Infection,,
Presentation,"-Dysuria.
-Frequency of urination.
-Suprapubic pain
-Fever.
-Loin/flank pain.",
Causes,"The pathogenesis of urinary tract infection begins with colonization of the vaginal introitus by uropathogens from the fecal flora, followed by ascension via the urethra into the bladder.

The microbial spectrum of uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women consists mainly of Escherichia coli (75 to 95 percent).

Occasionally, caused by other species of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other bacteria such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus

The main risk factors include recent sexual intercourse, recent spermicide use, and a history of urinary tract infection.

Urinary Tract Infections are common in our region due to chronic dehydration.",
Assessment,"Urinalysis by urine dipstick. Asses for leukocyte esterase, nitrite and haematuria. 

Leukocytes and nitrates are most accurate for predicting a UTI. Haematuria is useful in ruling out urethritis or vaginitis.

<b>Caution</b> A dipstick negative for both leukocyte esterase or nitrite cannot be reliably used to rule out infection if the history is strongly suggestive of urinary tract infection.",
Diagnosis,"The clinical diagnosis is made in a presentation consistent with that of a urinary tract infection and is supported by urinalysis evidence. 

We have found that 1+ or 2+ leukocytes are not uncommon in our patients, usually due to dehydration. 

If possible ensure the patient is hydrated before giving a sample and it is a clean catch midstream sample urine (MSSU) to avoid contamination and false positive results.

Occasionally, UTIs can present with haematuria also.

Due to potential complications, we have a lower threshold of treatment for pregnant women (not requiring nitrites).

<b>UTI in Pregnant women</b>  
Leukocytes 2+
If no nitrites repeat and treat if still 2+ leu.
          
<b>UTI in Men and Non-Pregnant Women</b> 
Leukocytes 2+, Nitrites +.
If no nitrites then unlikely UTI.

There is unilateral or bilateral loin pain, suprapubic pain or back pain. 

Fever is variable but can be high enough to produce rigors. 

Malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and occasionally diarrhoea occur. 

There may or may not be accompanying lower urinary tract symptoms with frequency, dysuria, gross haematuria or hesitancy. 

The patient looks ill and there is commonly pain on firm palpation of one or both kidneys and moderate suprapubic tenderness without guarding.

Presentation in children, especially when young, can be much less specific and culture of urine should be a routine investigation in pyrexial and unwell infants.

[1-4]",
Causes,"The source of the infection is often ascending infection from the bladder but haematogenous spread can also occur. The usual organisms are the same as for lower urinary tract infection (UTI): eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterococcus spp.

Incidence is highest in women aged, followed by infants and older people [4].

-No red reflex (any age).
-Not startling/ turning to noise (any age).
-Not walking by 18 months.
-Not talking by 2 years.
-Not toilet trained by age 4.

There are children in these communities with cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment and other congenital anomalies. Many of these children may never have seeked medical care before, therefore the understanding of their underlying condition may be largely unknown. 

With chronic conditions, emphasis is on education and support for the family on the best way to care for their child. Basic needs should be addressed and follow up is necessary. 

These patients should be supported to see a pediatrician to aid diagnosis and any treatment needed. Once a diagnosis has been documented by a Panamanian doctor then the family can apply for social support from the government (Angel Guardian).",
Causes,"The causes of developmental delay are multiple: [121]

<b>Delayed Motor Development</b>
Central: 
Cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, peripheral lesions, visual impairment - affecting fine motor

Systemic disorders: 
Hypothyroidism etc

Environmental: 
Malnutrition, lack of practice

<b>Delayed Speech / Language</b>
Central: 
Autism, global learning difficulty, isolated speech delay, hearing loss.

Environmental: 
Malnutrition, lack of practice

<b>Global Delay</b>
Cerebral malformations, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, chromosomal abnormalities, TORCH infections, toxin exposure and metabolic causes.",
Diagnosis,"Diagnosis will require referral to hospital. 

Liaise with a Lead Medical Provider if you suspect Developmental Delay in a patient. 

The Panamanian system can sometimes offer support (both financial and otherwise) to help the child and their family.",
Management,If any red flags are present the child needs to be referred to a general paediatrician. Consider formal vision/ hearing testing. ,
6.2 Seizures,,
Presentation,"“The clinical decision as to whether an epileptic seizure has occurred should be based on the combination of the description of the attack and different symptoms. A detailed history from the patient and any witness is essential.”

There are simple partial, complex partial and generalised seizures. Seizures can start as partial and progress to generalised.

<b>Tonic Clonic (Grand Mal)</b>
-Generalised seizure.
-Patient becomes rigid.
-Falls to floor.
-Jerking movements of all 4 limbs.
-Patient is unconscious and unresponsive.
-May bite tongue or double incontinence.
-Post ictal drowsiness - 30 minutes.

<b>Absence Seizure (Petit Mal)</b>
-Generalised Seizure.
-Patient becomes absent.
-Unresponsive.
-Will not remember the episode.

<b>Partial Seizures</b>
-Can be simple (conscious)
-Can be complex (impaired consciousness)
-Can affect motor, sensory, psyche.

[1]",
Causes,"There are numerous causes of seizures [2,3]. Seizures can be idiopathic (epilepsy), due to cerebrovascular disease, head injury, drug induced, due to metabolic disturbance amongst other factors.

A particular cause to think about in our setting is central nervous system infection. Panama is known to have relatively high rates of Neurocysticercosis [126–129] so consider this as a possibility.

Pseudoseizures should always be in the differential as they are not an uncommon presentation in any setting. ",
Diagnosis,"Whilst history is crucially important for the diagnosis of a cause of a seizure, it is equally as important that reversible causes are ruled out. As such referral to hospital where blood tests and imaging can be performed is crucial.",
Management,"Identify any potential triggers for seizures and educate accordingly.

<b>Potential Triggers</b>[2,3,4]
-Sleep deprivation.
-Medication non-adherence.
-Alcohol (Excess or withdrawal). 
-Drugs.
-Bright/Flashing lights.

If a patient is already established on medications, switching over to other ones can be extremely problematic if not monitored adequately. As such this should only be done by a specialist in our setting. 

If you know a patient is on medication, we can re-supply it. Alternatively, Friday follow up can be utilised to acquire the necessary medication and then provide it to the patient.

For decisions on whether or not to commence new medications, it is usually best to refer onto a specialist. This is because anti-epileptic drugs will often require close monitoring when first initiated [4,5].

<i>Carbamazepine.
Adult; Initially 400 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses, increased until symptoms controlled; usual dose 400–600 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses; maximum 1.6 g per day.
Child 5–11 years; Initially 5 mg/kg daily in 1–2 divided doses, then increased in steps of 2.5–5 mg/kg every 3–7 days as required, dose should be increased slowly; maintenance 10–15 mg/kg daily in 1–2 divided doses, increased if necessary up to 20 mg/kg daily in 1–2 divided doses.
Child 12–17 years; Initially 100–400 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses, then increased to 400–1200 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses, increased if necessary up to 1.8 g daily in 1–2 divided doses, dose should be increased slowly.</i> 

<b>Counselling on Contraception Methods for Women of Childbearing Age</b>
All women on carbamazepine should be offered contraception - including depo or referral for implanon/IUD/salpingectomy.
If a woman declines contraption despite counselling then 5mg folic acid should be given alongside carbamazepine (carbamazepine can be teratogenic but is less teratogenic than sodium valproate) and should be continued as long as she is not on definitive contraception.

Regarding neurocysticercosis; Albendazole can treat the causative Taenia solium [2], it is generally recommended that this be done in a secondary care setting. This is because the killing of the cysticerci can initially worsen inflammation and cerebral oedema [5,6,7]. As a result, high dose concomitant steroid therapy may also be required.",
Complications,"“Social stigmatisation and occupational issues. Psychosocial problems: Developmental problems in children with early-onset seizures. 

Specific cognitive and learning difficulties impacting on education if not recognised. AED side-effects; risk of fetal malformation associated with AEDs. 

Accidents resulting from a seizure often cause injuries - eg, head injuries, lacerations, fractures and burns.”",

7.1 Hypertension,,
Presentation,"Hypertension (HTN) is usually asymptomatic, except in accelerated hypertension.

All patients need a full history and physical examination. Look for a cause (renal, endocrine, etc, as above), particularly in the young, the severely hypertensive and those with resistant hypertension [1].

Everyone has high blood pressure from time to time. To make a diagnosis it is really important that a minimum of 3 high blood pressure readings are taken (at least 2 on separate visits) before starting someone on lifelong treatment with potential side effects.

[2]",
Causes,"Measure BP on at least 3 separate occasions: all readings need to be elevated for a diagnosis of hypertension.

Repeat readings can be taken on follow up before treatment started.

*If a patient has not had medications for a while and their BP is normal do not restart the medications.

In case of hypertensive urgency (systolic over 180 mmHg, over 120 mm Hg) without impending end-organ damage. Treatment should safely reduce BP over a few days. Given the setting we are in, admission to hospital should be considered.

If severe blood pressure is corrected to rapidly there is a risk of causing a hypoperfusion stroke.

7.2 Paediatric Heart Murmurs,,
Presentation,"Congenital heart disease affects 8 per 1000 born infants. 

The most common lesion is a VSD.  

In developed countries neonates have a ‘newborn check’ shortly after birth and again at 6 weeks, which includes auscultation for murmurs. 

Since most of our patients give birth in community, this screening is usually missed. 

ALWAYS examine heart sounds in children Under 2 years; this may be the first time they have seen a doctor.

Rheumatic fever due to untreated streptococcal infections may lead to valvular disease in older children- more commonly >3 years of age. 
",
Assessment,"<b>History</b>
Symptoms in infants: sweating, poor feeding, recurrent infections, failure to thrive. 

Symptoms in older children: shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, palpitations, chest pain. 

Do comprehensive birth and maternal history and family history. 

<b>Examination</b>
Plot height and weight and check centiles. 

Measure BP and oxygen saturations.

Signs of respiratory distress. 

Dysmorphic features: e.g. hypertelorism (wide set eyes), epicanthic folds, flat nasal bridge, abnormalities of the palate, absence of secondary sexual characteristics when they should be expected. 

The most common genetic syndrome is Down’s Syndrome. All babies/ children with Down’s syndrome require a paediatric echo even if they do not have a murmur. 

Full cardiovascular examination: pulses (always check femorals in babies), clubbing, surgical scars, murmurs, thrills, heaves, palpate liver. 

ECG/ Chest x-ray are NOT useful in the evaluation of paediatric murmurs. 
",
Diagnosis,"<b>Innocent Murmurs</b> 
-Seen in older children (over 2 years). 
-Soft. 
-Systolic. 
-Localised.
-Buzzing/ musical quality. 
-Vary with posture/ position. 
-Can be accentuated by hyperdynamic circulation during intercurrent illness. 
-No dysmorphic features. 
-Normal growth.

Hypoglycaemia,"<b>Causes</b>
-Secondary to diabetes medications.
-Breast feeding women who have not eaten.
-Fasting patients with no glycogen reserves.
-Reactive - after large meal.
-Chronic liver disease.
-Metastatic liver disease.

<b>Diagnosis</b>
-Blood glucose under 72mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L).
-Should always be treated.
-Repeat test if in doubt.

<b>Treatment</b>
Well patient:
Glucose 10-20g is given by mouth, either in liquid form or as granulated sugar (two teaspoons) or sugar lumps.

Repeat capillary blood glucose after 10-15 minutes; if the patient is still hypoglycaemic then the above can be repeated. 

If the patient is on Glibenclamide or other long acting diabetes medication, insert and IV cannula and monitor blood sugars for an hour (2-3 hours with glibenclamide). Rebound hypoglycemia may occur. Enure the patient continues to eat. Stop the offending medication and organise an urgent internal medicine review.

Unwell, drowsy or uncooperative patient:
Intravenous administration of 250-500ml, 5% dextrose STAT. At this stage emergency hospital admission will be necessary.

DKA and HHS,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are acute metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus that can occur in patients with both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Timely diagnosis, comprehensive clinical and biochemical evaluation, and effective management is key to the successful resolution of DKA and HHS. 

Critical components of the hyperglycemic crises management include coordinating fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement along with the continuous patient monitoring using available laboratory tools to predict the resolution of the hyperglycemic crisis.' [1]

<b>Causes of DKA and HHS</b>
-Previously undiagnosed patients.
-Poor medication adherence.
-Infection/Sepsis.
-Dehydration/vomiting.
-Alcohol.
-Trauma/surgery.
-PE, MI, other stress.

<b>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)</b>
-Raised Blood Sugar                              AND
-Raised Ketones (Urinary++/serum) AND           
-Acidosis 
-More common in type 1 DM.

Patients are usually unwell or comatosed. They have the characteristic 'pear drop' breath smell (from the ketones). We cannot confirm DKA diagnosis but if a patient is unwell has a high blood sugar and urinary ketones +++ then have a low threshold to manage as DKA. Children often complain of abdominal pain. DKA usually occurs within hours of the precipitating factor. 

Mangagement:

8.1 Diabetes,,
Presentation,"Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia and (in type 1 diabetes or advanced type 2 diabetes) unexplained weight loss.

If weightloss always check for ketones in the urine. ++ ketones and raised blood sugar is consistent with DKA and would warrant urgent treatment and transfer to hospital.

[1]",
Causes,"<b>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</b>
-Autoimmune disease.
-Causes destruction of Islet cells.
-Decreased insulin production.

<b>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</b>
-Genetic and environmental factors.
-Strong association with truncal obesity.
-Insulin resistance.
-Initially increased insulin production.
-Later stages; decreased insulin production.

<b>'Type 3' Diabetes Mellitus</b>
-From damage to the pancreas.
-e.g. chronic pancreatitis.
-Destruction of islet cells.
-Decreased insulin production.
-Usually have exocrine dysfunction also.

[2]
",
Assessment,"A routine Diabetes check-up should include the following points:
Blood Sugar Level (BSL) in clinic (and BSL diary from home if patient has own machine). 

In general aim for BSL between 4-7 mmol/L (72-126 mg/dL). However, must be less strict (6-10) if a patient is at risk of hypoglycaemia (i.e. on Glibenclamide or insulin).

Check blood pressure (see Hypertension 7.2) and urine dipstick (for blood and protein).

Ensure secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular events with regular Aspirin 81 mg once a day if necessary (e.g. history of Ischaemic Heart Disease, Stroke/TIA, or Peripheral Vascular Disease). Aspirin is not given for primary prevention due to higher risks versus benefits.

(DM risk factor table)

Review of risk factors and lifestyle advice (above).

Examination for peripheral neuropathy and advice regarding foot and nail care.

Enquire about any episodes of hypoglycaemia if on second line agent.

Review of medication – dose, side effects, problems and adherence.

Mark for check up next clinic.

Diabetic patients should have early Hba1c levels and creatinine levels.

If signs of secondary organ damage (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, PVD) or poor glycaemic control despite maximum oral therapy please discuss with the Lead Medical Provider regarding if a referral to secondary care is warranted.

",dm_risk_factor_table
Diagnosis,"To make a diagnosis of Diabetes two separate high Blood Sugar levels (BSLs) (including one fasting BSL) OR one high reading in the presence of symptoms is necessary.

Occasionally a high reading may occur if a patient has a concurrent acute illness (especially infection), it is best to repeat a fasting BSL after the treatment of the illness before diagnosing Diabetes.

Please ensure you are familiar with the different units used to measure BSL (mmol/L and mg/dL) to avoid diagnostic confusion. A conversion chart is available in clinic.

<b>Diabetes</b>
Random BSL 200mg/dL or more (11.1 mmol/L).
Fasting BSL 126mg/dL or more (7.0 mmol/L). 

<b>Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)</b>
Random BSL 140 - 199 mg/dL (7.8 - 11.0 mmol/L)
Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG):
Fasting BSL 100 - 125 mg/dL (5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L)

Patients with IGT and IFG are at high risk of developing Diabetes. These patients should be given the same lifestyle advice as patients with Type 2 Diabetes to help delay the onset of diabetes. The same risk factors should be addressed also.

The diagnosis of IGT is usually made with an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) after abnormally high BSL (but not meeting the criteria for Diabetes). However, the OGTT is not easily available in our setting so ensure these patients have a fasting blood glucose taken and advice/treatment is based on that result.

If possible a yearly HBa1C and renal function should be performed for monitoring treatment.

[3]
",
Management,"<b>Type 1 Diabetes</b>
Very uncommon in the communities but have a low threshold to check blood sugar in unwell children, children with malnutrition, failure to thrive or recurrent infections. We have a few type 2 diabetes patients with insulin dependance; these patients are very difficult to manage in a remote setting.

Children with diabetes need to be managed by a hospital specialist.

<b>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</b>
First line: 
Metformin 500mg 1xday, 1 week.*
Then increase to 1000mg 1x/day.

If not controlled next clinic:
Increase to 1000mg 2x/day.

If not controlled next clinic:
Increase to 850 mg 3x/day. (max dose 2.5g per day). 

*<i>Decreases rate of side effects patients experience. If patients experience lots of diarrhoea etc in the first week of treatment, they are unlike to continue treatment. Give at time of biggest meal.</i>

<i>Metformin does not cause hypoglycemia but Glibenclamide can.</i> 
        
Second line:*
Glibenclamide 5mg 1x/day.**
Increase by 5 every 3 months.
Max. 15mg 1x/day.

(Can cause very refractory hypoglycemia requiring hospitalisation, so aim for higher blood sugars when on this). 

*ONLY if control is not good with maximum metformin dose or metformin not tolerated.

**Glibenclamide can cause very refractory hypoglycemia requiring hospitalisation, so you must aim for higher blood sugars when a patient is taking this. It must <b>ALWAYS</b> be taken with food and used with caution in the elderly and renal disease. <b>The patient must skip this medication if not eating or is eatting less than usual</b>. Counsel on hypoglycaemia awareness and management. If patients experience a hypo they must stop glibenclamide and go to the hospital for a check up.
",

9.4 Foreign body and Wax,,
Presentation,"Ear Wax acts as an agent to protect the ear, for example from insects – due to the naturally bitter composition of the wax, and to help remove small foreign particles such as dust. 

Ears are naturally self-cleaning, but on occasion the cerumen may need intervention to remove it. 

This can occur if there is wax impaction or if there is a foreign body in the ear canal.",
Causes,"In the case of wax impaction, symptoms can include hearing problems, itching, discomfort and tinnitus. Balance may sometimes be affected.",
Assessment,Inspection using otoscope.,
Management,"For hard wax resistant to ear wicking dissolve 1/4 tsp sodium bicarbonate in 10 mls of water and irrigate the ear. 

An alternative is a few drops of acetic acid to soften wax prior to irrigation. 

Foreign bodies can be removed with tweezers, or irrigation with clean water and a 50ml syringe.

For impacted ear wax: docusate sodium twice a day is also an easy and effective treatment, especially if you want to have another look in a patient's ears for follow up, this will often clear all the wax out in a few days.",
Complications,"Complications can be variable; such as infection, tympanic membrane perforation.",

Assessment,"PID becomes highly likely if one or more of these symptoms are seen in association with these clinical signs.

<b>History</b>
-Abdominal/pelvic pain.
-Dyspareunia.
-Dysmenorrhoea.
-Vaginal discharge.
-Dysuria.
-Fever.
-Nausea and vomiting.

<b>Examination</b>

11.2.2.3 Ovarian Pathology,,
Definitions,"Ovarian Cyst: Over 3 cm. 

Ovarian follicle: Under 3cm.",
Pre-Menopausal Women,"Ovarian cysts are very common in women of reproductive age and generally do not cause symptoms.

Consider an ovarian cyst if the patient has persistent localised pain that does not resolve despite regular simple analgesia or fullness or a mass, with associated tenderness is elicited on bimanual examination. 

Refer to local hospital for transabdominal pelvic ultrasound if above criteria met 

Simple ovarian cysts under 50mm usually resolve in 2-3 menstrual cycles without intervention and do not require further follow up.

Ovarian cysts 50-70mm should have yearly ultrasound to look for enlargement or persistence, at which stage surgical intervention might be indicated. Non-simple cysts are unlikely to resolve and may need further investigation. 

Refer to gynaecology for large or non-simple ovarian cysts.

Warn patients to seek medical attention urgently if they develop acute severe pain that is constant or intermittent especially if associated with nausea and vomiting, due to the risk of ovarian torsion.
",
Post-Menopausal Women,"5-17% of post-menopausal women have ovarian cysts and most are benign. However the risk of malignancy is much higher than in pre-menopausal women.

-Persistent bloating.
-Loss of appetite or feeling full.
-Persistent pelvic or abdominal pain.
-Increased urgency or frequency.

<i>Consider a direct referral to a private gynaecologist for urgent review if the above symptoms are associated with a history of weight loss, pelvic mass and or positive family history.</i>

Any incidental findings of ovarian cysts should be referred for gynaecology review so that trans-vaginal ultrasound and Ca125 can be completed.

Information,For women with pelvic pain who have recently delivered: please see the post-partum section of this guideline.,
11.2.3.1 Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,,
Presentation,"Previously termed 'Menorrhagia.' 

Heavy menstrual loss can be extremely distressing for patients leading to limitations in physical, social and leisure activities. [1]



",hmb_table
Causes,"There are multiple causes of menorrhagia.

<b>Local Causes</b> [2]
-Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.
-Fibroids.
-Adenomyosis.
-Endometrial Polyps.
-Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma.
-Endometritis.

<b>Systemic disorders</b>[3]
-Hypothyroidism.
-Liver or Kidney disease.
-Von Willebrand's disease.

Contraception [4] - particularly IUCDs.

Some cases are associated with anovulatory cycles and this tends to occur around the extremes of reproductive life. [5,6]

In some women, no cause can be found. This is known as Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding. [5-7] ",
Assessment,"Patients presenting with any ‘Red Flags’ should be referred urgently to a specialist or emergency department as appropriate

<b>Red Flags</b>
Persistent intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding

New onset HMB over 45yr

Any episodes of postmenopausal bleeding

Any vulval, vaginal or cervical lesions

Haemoglobin <8

Positive pregnancy test  

<b>Investigations</b>
Hemocue.
 
Pregnancy test: 
If acute bleeding or chronic bleeding post miscarriage or normal delivery.

Pelvic Ultrasound:
If trained provider available, but keep in mind that transabdominal scan  (TA USS) may miss pathology. Consider referral for transvaginal ultrasound (TV USS) if pathology suspected clinically, even if TA USS appears normal.

<i>If history, examination findings and Hb are reassuring start medical treatment. Treatment options will depend on patients wish to preserve fertility or not and personal preference. All options should be discussed and patients wishes respected.</i>

",
Treatment,"<b>Non-Hormonal</b>
Tranexamic Acid 1g orally.
3x/day; first 4 days of menstrual period.
                 AND
Mefenamic Acid 500mg orally.
3x/day; first 4 days of menstrual period.

<i>Both can be prescribed individually but combined provide a synergistic effect</i>

<b>Hormonal</b>
-Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill.
-Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate.*

<i>*See contraception guideline for details on initiation</i>

If patients symptoms are persistently troublesome despite medical management, patient should be referred to a specialist for possible surgical intervention

Definitions,"<b>Primary Amenorrhea</b>
Menses have not occurred by the time of the expected menarche. 
That is 14 years with no other signs of secondary sexual characteristics or 16 years with other signs.

<b>Secondary Amenorrhea</b>
Menstruation has previously occurred but it has stopped.

",
Causes,"<b>Primary</b>
-Pregnancy.
-Constitutional delay.
-Genitourinary malformation.
-Hyperprolactinaemia.
-Hypothalamic failure.
-0varian failure.

<b>Secondary</b>
-Pregnancy.*
-Lactation.*

Management,"This will be largely dependent on the underlying cause. 

<b>Secondary to progestogen contraceptives</b>
Reassure patient that this is a normal side effect and that menstruation will restart after cessation.

<b>Primary Amenorrhoea Under 16yr</b> 
(with normal secondary sexual characteristics)
Reassure that this is likely constitutional.
However ensure follow up is completed. 

<b>If PCOS has been confirmed or highly suspected</b>
Give lifestyle advice in order to reduce BMI. 

Reduction of 5-10% of body weight may be sufficient to restore fertility and metabolic parameters.  

PCOS patients should have a withdrawal bleed every 3 months to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia therefore starting the COCP may be advisable. 

However in the majority of cases referral to specialist for further investigation will be required

11.2.3.3 Intermenstrual Bleeding and Post-Coital Bleeding,,
Definition,Bleeding that occurs between clearly defined menses and non-menstrual genital tract bleeding that occurs immediately or shortly after intercourse. ,
Management,"Speculum examination is required on all patients if symptoms are persistent; if no trained provider is available refer to hospital.

<b>Speculum Exam</b>
Ectropion – can be cauterized using silver nitrate.

Cervical lesions – refer to hospital for Colposcopy urgently.

Endometrial or Cervical polyp – refer to hospital for specialist review.

Cervicitis – treat for STI.

Vaginitis – treat for vaginal infection. 

Advise all women 21 years and older or who are younger but have initiated sexual intercourse ≥2 years previously to attend for a cervical smear (Papanicolaou) unless one has been completed within 2 years, as per Panamanian guidelines. ",
11.2.3.4 Post-Menopausal Bleeding,,
Definitions,"In women over 45 years you can clinically diagnose.

<b>Menopause</b> 
No menstrual period for 1 year.

<b>Perimenopausal</b> 
Vasomotor symptoms and irregular periods. 

",
Management,Any women who reports vaginal bleeding after menopause should be referred to a specialist for urgent ultrasound +/- endometrial biopsy,
11.2.4 Urinary Incontinence,,
Presentation,"Urinary incontinence can be divided into those with stress, urge and mixed incontinence. 

Stress urinary incontinence.

Usually small volumes of urine.

Leaks when heavy lifting, coughing or during intercourse.

Urge incontinence.

Experience strong urgent urges to empty the bladder.

Will likely have increased urinary frequency.
 
Leaks before manages to get to the toilet or on stimuli such as hearing running water.

Usually involve larger volumes of urine.

Patients with mixed incontinence have a combination of the above, but one type will predominate.
",
Assessment,"All patients must be screened for acute urine infection 
",
Urge Incontinence,"<b>Reduce bladder irritants</b>
-Caffeine.
-Soda.
-Citrus fruit juices.
-Alcohol.

<b>Increase water intake</b>
Many women reduce fluid intake to the reduce risk of leaking, however concentrated urine will exacerbate symptoms.

<b>Weight loss if BMI above 30</b>
Pelvic floor exercises as above will greatly improve success with bladder training 

<b>Medical Treatment</b>
Anticholinergic medications
Advise patients on common side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision. 
Reassure that side effects are a sign that the medication is working and that they should improve with time. 
The full benefit of anticholinergics will take around four weeks to become apparent. 

1st Line 
Oxybutynin 5 mg 2x/day.
Can be increased to 3x/day if tolerated.
<i>Oxybutynin 2.5mg 2x/day if frail and elderly.</i>

2nd Line 
Tolterodine 2 mg 2x/day.

<i>Start with 1st line medications and only change onto 2nd line if after 4 weeks of use if side effects cannot be tolerated, or no benefit felt at maximum dosage. If frail and elderly, either start on 2nd line or consider oxybutynin at lower dose. </i>

<b>Referral to Specialist</b>
Only consider once conservative and medical managements have been exhausted.

",
Stress Urinary Incontinence,"Pelvic Floor Exercises can be hugely beneficial. Explain to patients that with any exercise it will take time to see results and should be continued for a minimum of 3 months.

Referral to specialist if exercises not successful.

Only consider referral if above measures have failed and patient wants to proceed to surgical management 
",
Bladder Training,"The aim of bladder training is to reduce the frequency of urination and increase the volume the bladder can hold.

Ascertain how often the patient is passing urine daily.
e.g 7x a day every 2 hours, then write a time table.
Increasing the intervals between urination by 15 min. 

Advise the patient that they need to stick to the schedule.
Holding if they have the urge to go sooner,
or still trying to empty the bladder even if the urge is not felt. 

If an urge to urinate is felt before the scheduled void, 
use pelvic floor exercises and deep relaxing breaths until the sensation passes.

The intervals between urination should be increased every week if the current schedule can be achieved.

Increase by 15 min intervals until there is 3-4 hours between each void.

Reassure patients that bladder training can be challenging and they will have good days and bad days but if they keep with the schedule the times between voids will gradually improve. ",
Pelvic Floor Exercise,"Have the patient demonstrate pelvic floor exercises during a vaginal examination to ensure they are activating the correct muscles. You should feel a muscular lifting and tightening around your fingers. 

<b>Advice to patients:</b>
Sit or stand in a comfortable position.

Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from passing wind at the same time as you are trying to stop passing urine and slowly squeeze and lift the muscles.

A feeling of tightening in the lower abdomen is normal.

Try to avoid pulling in your stomach, squeezing your legs together, tightening your buttocks or holding your breath.

Tighten and release 15 times every morning and evening.

Increase to 15 repetitions 3x daily on next review after demonstrating correct technique.",
11.2.4 Prolapse,,
Presentation,"Falling, slipping or downward displacement of the uterus and/or the different vaginal compartments and their neighbouring organs such as bladder, rectum or bowel.

Prolapse is very common and for many women is asymptomatic. 

The most common symptom is a vaginal bulge but many women may not report this voluntarily. 

In women reporting lower back or abdominal discomfort enquire about symptoms of vaginal bulge, dragging sensation or fullness and urinary incontinence.

<b>Types</b>
Anterior Wall (Cystocele):
When the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina.

Posterior Wall (Rectocele):
When the rectum bulges into the back wall of the vagina.

Uterine prolapse:
When the uterus hangs down into the vagina and may eventually protrude outside the body (Procidentia).",
Assessment,"<b>Examination</b>
Women should initially be examined supine but asked to bear down to reveal the full extent of the prolapse.

If the patient reports bulge but none demonstrated, re-examine in a standing or squatting position. 

Simplified POP-Q staging

Identify the hymenal remnant and assess where the leading edge of the prolapse is in relation to this fixed landmark at maximum protrusion (i.e. when bearing down or standing).

(Prolapse staging table)

The Most distal portion is Anterior, Central or Posterior
",prolapse_staging_table
Management,"Only women with symptomatic prolapse require treatment.

<b>Conservative Management</b>
Avoid factors that increase intra-abdominal pressure.

Treat constipation with increased fluid intake and laxatives as required.

Treat chronic cough.

Avoid heavy lifting.

Reduce BMI, particularly if over 30.

Pelvic floor exercises (see under stress urinary incontinence).

<b>Pessaries</b>
Pessaries are plastic devices that can be used to hold a prolapsed uterus or vaginal walls in place to relieve symptoms. 

They are an excellent choice for patients not keen for or not eligible for surgery. 

Pessaries should only be fitted on clinic days when follow up is possible 1-2 days later.

*<i>Ask women to keep and return a pessary if it falls out as this can be sterilised for another patient.</i>
",
Follow Up,"<b>First Follow Up</b>
Pessary has not fallen out (if so try bigger size).

Pessary is not causing discomfort (try smaller size).

Patient is able to pass urine (try smaller size).

<b>Every 3 Months</b>
Ask about offensive discharge or bleeding.

Remove pessary – see full guideline for more information.

Examine the vaginal walls using cusco speculum looking for any areas of erosion or ulceration.

Wash the pessary with filtered water, apply topical oestrogen cream and re-site.

<b>Erosions, Ulcerations or Offensive Discharge</b>
Give course of topic oestrogen.

Finger tip of oestrogen cream into the vagina 2x daily for one week.

Remove the pessary.

Can be re-fitted next clinic or if possible the patient can attend base in 2-3 weeks.

If significant offensive vaginal discharge treat with oral Metronidazole 500mg 2x daily for 5 days.

<b>Specialist Referral if..</b> 
An area of ulceration persists despite treatment and pessary break.

Bleeding reported by a postmenopausal patient and no area of erosion seen.

Patient with a G2 or lower prolapses who are still symptomatic despite a minimum of 6 months of pelvic floor exercises AND have either declined or been dissatisfied with a pessary AND are keen to proceed to surgical management.

Patient with a G3 or higher prolapses who have either declined or been dissatisfied with a pessary AND are keen to proceed to surgical management.

Advise patients to continue or start pelvic floor training while awaiting specialist review.

Bleeding in Early Pregnancy,"<b>Three Possible Diagnoses</b>
-Ectopic Pregnancy.
-Miscarriage.
-Normal pregnancy.

<b>Complete a History and Examination</b>

If on speculum examination products of conception are visible in the cervical os, remove these with sponge holding forceps as it may arrest bleeding and vagal induced bradycardia. 

If only light spotting is found and there is no history of abdominal pain, or any elicited on examination, the patient can be reassured. However they should be advised to attend hospital immediately if pain develops or bleeding increases. 

<b>Referral Criteria</b>
-Abdominal pain and bleeding.
-Lower abdominal tenderness on examination.
-Active miscarriage.
-Early pregnancy with history of collapse 
-Early pregnancy with diarrhoea and lower abdominal pain with no previous scan.
",
11.3.2 Antenatal Period,,
Pregnancy Diagnosis,"Pregnancy test are available in clinic. 

Occasionally we may be in short supply and they should be reserved for women presenting with abdominal pain, where an ectopic pregnancy is a differential. 

Ultrasound scanning is also available in clinic, however occasionally it may be limited to women in the third trimester or women with concerning clinical features, due to the limited battery reserve. 

Be cautious when prescribing medications to women as many may have an undiagnosed pregnancy.",
11.3.3 Antenatal Care,,
Information,"There is a variable amount of antenatal care available within the communities and at the nearest health services. 

In some of the communities all of the women will plan to give birth at home with a Partera (Traditional birthing assistant), whereas, in other communities they will all plan on giving birth at the local hospital. 

All of the pregnant women come to clinic hoping for an ultrasound and keen to know the health and sex of their baby.

11.3.4 Gestational Age and Fetal Growth,,
Assessment in Clinic,"Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) and gestational age should be calculated using the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) using a pregnancy wheel or App. 

<b>Once gestational age has been identified</b>
All pregnant women >24 weeks gestation a symphysis fundal height (SFH) measurement should be recorded at every visit.

SFH measurement taken and any measurements previously recorded by Centro De Salud should be recorded if available.

Please see the Long Version of the guidelines for a practical guide on how to do this

If measurements fall above the 90th or below the 10th centile or flattening or downward trend of multiple measurements are seen, the patient should be referred for a hospital ultrasound.

If the patient is <26 weeks gestation and a suitably trained person is available, a BPD and FL should be completed.

If the patient is >26 weeks gestation single biometry measurements are not recommended but the decision lies with the individual trained provider. 
",
11.3.5 Fetal Movements,,
Assessment in Clinic,"Should be enquired about at each visit from 25 weeks.

<b>Inform Patients</b>
A happy baby is an active baby.

Any reduction in the babies normal frequency of movements should prompt review by a medical professional. 

As the baby gets closer to delivery the movements will become smaller and more subtle but the overall frequency should not reduce.

<b>Reduced Movements Reported</b>
-Check fetal heart with Doppler of Ultrasound.
-Refer to hospital for review.
",
11.3.6 Anaemia in pregnancy,,
Management,"All pregnant women should have a Hemocue test for haemoglobin at ever visit.

All women should have a sample taken to confirm blood group and Rhesus status once during their pregnancy (see ‘infection screening in pregnancy’ for protocol on taking antenatal blood).

All women planning pregnancy, pregnant or up to 3 months postpartum should receive prenatal vitamins. 

All women from ≥ Second trimester should receive anti-helmanith tablet (Albendazole 400 mg stat) to prevent anaemia at every visit.

<b>Iron Treatment</b>
First trimester:
Less than 11 g/dL.

Second and third trimesters:
Less than 10.5 g/dL.

Consider referral for hospital review if Hb ≤80 g/L (8.5 g/dL) or symptomatic",
11.3.7 Screening in Pregnancy,,
National Guidelines,"All women should have blood taken for infection screening once during their pregnancy. As per Panamanian guidelines all women should be tested for HIV, rubella, toxoplasmosis, Hep B and CMV.

If a woman has not had a screen in this pregnancy take blood. Blood bottles should be placed in the cooler while in clinic and during transport back to base. 

All patients from whom blood has been taken must be entered into the patient follow up database. 

Inform the patient that if the results are negative we will bring their results next clinic, if they are positive we will contact them sooner. 
",
11.3.8 Vaginal Bleeding In Pregnancy,,
Management,"Complete a history and examination. 

Do not do a digital vaginal examination in case placenta praevia. 

A speculum examination is safe and can diagnose other causes such as a polyp or ectropion. 

Confirm placental location with ultrasound

Unless only very light spotting with no associated pain is seen, all women should be referred for hospital review",
11.3.9 Rupture of Membranes,,
Management,"Rupture of the amniotic membrane leading to leakage of amniotic fluid or liquor should be enquired about at every visit. 

Prolonged rupture of membranes can lead to chorioamnionitis, fetal distress, intrauterine death and maternal sepsis

<b>Women will describe</b>
A large gush of fluid if fore-waters have broken.

A continuous leakage or wetness if there is a hind-water leak.

Any leakage of green fluid/discharge may be either infection or meconium.

<b>Confirmation</b> 
Cases of ruptured membranes can be confirmed by a pooling of liquor on speculum examination however it does not exclude the diagnosis in a hind-water leak

<b>SROM Referral Criteria</b>
All preterm pregnancies with SROM.

Term (>37 weeks) with no signs of active labour >24 hours after membrane rupture.

Any women with signs of infection and a history of ruptured membranes should receive antibiotics prior to transfer to hospital. 

If stable: 
Metronidazole 500mg PO and Cephalexin 500mg PO single dose 

If septic:  
Metronidazole 500mg PO and Ceftriaxone 1g IV/IM single dose

<b>Large for Dates</b>
SFH is on or above the 90th centile when plotted or  BPD is 2 weeks above the gestational age from LMP.

For many of our women this discrepancy will be due to the inaccuracy of their gestation from their LMP. 

However it is important to identify the few babies who may be growth restricted or macrosomic",
Management,"Any diagnosis of SFD or LFD should be referred for immediate repeat hospital scan unless: 

There is a provider available with skilled at scanning for fetal biometry

",
Two or More Previous C-sections,"Will require repeat Caesarean delivery.

Ensure women have attended hospital for delivery planning by latest of 36 weeks.

All Women with Previous C-section,"Should attend immediately if develop labour pain, rupture of membranes or bleeding.

Should be referred immediately for Ultrasound and review if found to have an anterior low lying placenta due to the risk of placenta Accreta.",
11.3.15 Teenage Pregnancy,,
Our Policy,"Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see girls as young as 13 years old pregnant in our communities. 

It is important that the circumstances surrounding these pregnancies are asked about sensitively and details documented in the antenatal proforma.

Age of partner.

Was the conception consensual or non consensual?

Is the patient supported by the partner +/or family, for example are they attending clinic alone, are they still in school and will the father be involved once the child is born?

Under Panamanian law all pregnancies in women under the age of 18 years must be reported to the Public Ministry within 14 days or within 24 hours if a crime is suspected.

Please see the Teenage Pregnancy Reporting policy for full details on how to report cases.",
1.3.16 Delivery Planning,,
Planning in clinic,"Many women will want to deliver at home, either alone or with a Partera (local traditional birth attendant) but many also want to deliver in a Centro de Salud or Hospital.

The below list comprises contraindications to home birth. If a woman has any of these factors, she should be strongly counselled against home delivery however the decision ultimately lies with the women. This list is not exhaustive so if you have any concerns please discuss them with the Float LMP.

<b>Contraindications to home delivery</b>
-Grand Multiparity (5 deliveries or more).
-Age under 14 years.
-Transverse lie or Breech presentation.
-Multiple gestations (twins or triplets).
-Previous Post-Partum Haemorrhage.
-Previous Caesarean section.
-Significant co-existing medical conditions (inc diabetes, epilepsy, valvular heart disease).

Whatever the desired delivery location, all women should have a plan of how they will transfer to a hospital either when labour starts or in an emergency.

<b>Points to discuss</b>
-Who will take them.
-How will they get there.
-How will they pay for transport.
-Who will care for other children.

A plan does not need to be made at clinic but it is important to raise these issues to encourage planning. 

Emphasise that it is much easier to plan now than during an emergency.
",
11.3.17 Prolonged Pregnancy,,
Information,All women 41/40 weeks of pregnancy not showing signs of imminent labour should be referred to hospital for a plan to be made for induction of labour.,
11.3.18 Postpartum,,
Information,"If reviewing a woman the following topics should be discussed. Some areas may be more or less relevant depending on the time lapsed since delivery however all should be mentioned briefly. 

",
Delivery review,"What kind of delivery did she have and where did it take place?

How does the patient feel about the delivery did it go as planned, if not why?

Where there any complications, what impact could these have for a future pregnancy or delivery?

If this discussion brings up any points or topics you are unsure of, discuss them with the float LMP.
",
Lochia,"Lochia, bleeding after delivery, can persist for 6 weeks. However it should be gradually reducing in quantity and changing from fresh blood through to brownish or pinkish red through to pinkish white.

While clots can be normal in the first few days, if they are persistent or associated with heavy bleeding this may be a sign of infection, endometritis, or retained products of conception.  A lochia pattern that is not gradually resolving, but is instead swinging from heavy to light can also indicate the same. 

<b>If There is Concern</b>
Check Hb and treat anaemia as appropriate.

If well and bleeding not heavy, give oral antibiotics. 

Metronidazole 500mg PO TDS  and Cephalexin 500mg PO TDS for 7 days. 

If bleeding heavy, has significant lower abdominal pain or tenderness , is septic or symptoms don't respond to oral antibiotics refer to hospital for review and ultrasound to look for products of conception.

BEWARE it is very difficult to distinguish between blood and products of conception on USS postpartum.
",
Breast Feeding,"Always give clear and specific advice on the importance of breastfeeding.
",
Perineum,"Ask if she is passing urine and opening the bowels regularly.

Ask if she had any tears during delivery requiring suturing.

Ask if she is having any perineal pain.

Perineal pain should gradually improve post delivery, if it is increasing or associated with heat or offensive smell, examine for sign of infection.

Perineal sutures should usually be dissolvable and therefore not require removal.

If a previously repaired perineal tear has broken down, never attempt to re-suture, give antibiotics keep area clean (use clean water only)  and dry and allow to heal by secondary intention.

Metronidazole 500mg PO TDS      AND 
Cephalexin 500mg PO TDS 
For 7 days. 
",
"Family Planning
","The postpartum period is a very important opportunity to discuss family planning and must be discussed with all patients.

No method of family planning is required in the first 21 days after delivery, but methods can be initiated during this period if desired.

Women who are fully breastfeeding and amenorrhoeic can use this as a form of contraception for the first six months after delivery.

Stopping night time feeds, introducing supplementary feeds, using dummies or pacifiers or expressing milk can reduce the effectiveness.

Depot can be started any time after delivery <b>including immediately post-delivery</b>

Give antenatal vitamins to all women after birth and all women of childbearing age.

$Emergency Presentations,,
12.1 Hypoglycaemia,,
Causes,"-Secondary to diabetes medications.
-Breast feeding women who have not eaten.
-Fasting patients with no glycogen reserves.
-Reactive - after large meal.
-Chronic liver disease.
-Metastatic liver disease.",
Diagnoses,"-Blood glucose under 72mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L).
-Should always be treated.
-Repeat test if in doubt",
Treatment,"Well patient:
Glucose 10-20g is given by mouth, either in liquid form or as granulated sugar (two teaspoons) or sugar lumps.

Repeat capillary blood glucose after 10-15 minutes; if the patient is still hypoglycaemic then the above can be repeated. 

If the patient is on Glibenclamide or other long acting diabetes medication, insert and IV cannula and monitor blood sugars for an hour (2-3 hours with glibenclamide). Rebound hypoglycemia may occur. Enure the patient continues to eat. Stop the offending medication and organise an urgent internal medicine review.

Unwell, drowsy or uncooperative patient:
Intravenous administration of 250-500ml, 5% dextrose STAT. At this stage emergency hospital admission will be necessary.

12.2 DKA and HSS,,
Presentation,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are acute metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus that can occur in patients with both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Timely diagnosis, comprehensive clinical and biochemical evaluation, and effective management is key to the successful resolution of DKA and HHS. 

Critical components of the hyperglycemic crises management include coordinating fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement along with the continuous patient monitoring using available laboratory tools to predict the resolution of the hyperglycemic crisis.' ",
Causes,"<b>Causes of DKA and HHS</b>
-Previously undiagnosed patients.
-Poor medication adherence.
-Infection/Sepsis.
-Dehydration/vomiting.
-Alcohol.
-Trauma/surgery.
-PE, MI, other stress.",
Diagnosis,"<b>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)</b>
-Raised Blood Sugar                              AND
-Raised Ketones (Urinary++/serum) AND           
-Acidosis 
-More common in type 1 DM.

Patients are usually unwell or comatosed. They have the characteristic 'pear drop' breath smell (from the ketones). We cannot confirm DKA diagnosis but if a patient is unwell has a high blood sugar and urinary ketones +++ then have a low threshold to manage as DKA. Children often complain of abdominal pain. DKA usually occurs within hours of the precipitating factor.

12.3 Sepsis,,
Definition,"Sepsis is defined as a “life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection”. 

The progression includes: infection → bacteremia → sepsis → severe sepsis → septic shock → multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) → death. 

Early identification and appropriate management is essential for improved outcomes in septic patients. 

The main goal for management in our setting is rapid restoration of perfusion, early administration of antibiotics and urgent transport to the nearest secondary care facility. ",

-Systolic BP under 100 mmHg.
-Altered mental status.

<i>*qSOFA - Quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment.</i>

A detailed history & physical examination is crucial to evaluate for a source of infection. 

A full systems review should be performed to look for infective signs and symptoms, multiple sources may be found. 
",
Immediate Management,"<b>Secure Airway</b>
Intubation/mechanical ventilation may be required if the patient has encephalopathy or decreased level of consciousness (GCS under 8).

<b>Correct Hypoxemia</b>
Provide supplemental O2 to all septic patients. 

Flow rate of 4-10 L/min with a simple face mask. 

Continuously monitor pulse oximetry to achieve target 94-98% O2 saturation (unless known Severe COPD, 92% may be more appropriate to avoid type 2 respiratory failure).

<b>Establish IV Access</b>
At least 2 peripheral venous lines for fluids and antibiotics, (Minimum gauge - pink 20G, ideally green 18G).
",
Resuscitation,"Early fluid resuscitation is a priority in sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, which may be manifested by low blood pressure, decreased cap refill, decreased urine output, and/or altered mental status. Aggressive IV fluids with normal saline should be given within the first 3 hours of presentation. 

<b>Adults</b>
Initially with repeated fluid challenges of 500ml. 

500ml of fluid is given stat and the patient is reassessed afterwards for improvement and for signs of fluid overload. 

Once the blood pressure and heart rate and urine output have improved, fluids can be given over 2-4 hours with regular monitoring.

*<i>In elderly patients, malnourished patients and patients with known heart/kidney disease you should be much more cautious and start with 250ml bolus fluid challenges.</i>

<b>Children</b> 
WHO guidelines recommend initial fluid resuscitation in paediatrics with severe hypotension: 

Under 12 months old: SBP under 50 mmHg
1-5 years old: SBP under 60 mmHg
over 5 years old: SBP under 70 mmHg

Over 2 years- Normal saline 20 mL/kg IV bolus (under 5 minutes).

Malnourished children and children under 2 years - Normal Saline 10 ml/kg IV bolus (under 5 minutes).

Continually reassess perfusion status and administer repeated boluses until perfusion has improved, blood pressure is acceptable, or signs of fluid overload develop (ie. pulmonary edema). 

Be wary of administering too much fluid in patients with history of chronic heart failure.

12.6 Envenomation,,
12.6.1 Snake bites,,
Background,"Up to 5 million snake bites annually with 94000 - 125000 deaths globally. 

Dry bites (a bite where no venom is injected) occur in between 25% - 50% of snake bites, other literature shows even higher numbers of >50%. 

The outcome of a venomous bite depends on snake species, amount of venom, location of the bite (head and neck are most dangerous), patient age/weight/fitness and time to receive medical attention.
 
Snake bites are most common among people living in rural, resource-poor settings, who subsist on low-cost, non-mechanical farming and other field occupations. 

Agricultural workers, women and children are the groups most frequently bitten by snakes.
 
Panama has the highest incidence of snake bites of Central America (2800 bites per year). 

<b>This region has two main types of snakes</b>

Neurotoxic snakes in the region (coral snakes): neuromuscular blockage predominantly induced by post-synaptically acting low molecular mass neurotoxins which can lead to muscle paralysis.

Proteolytic venom snakes (fer de lance, known locally as 'dos equis.' and the bushmaster being the two most common) which cause tissue damage at the bite site.
",
Assessment,"Symptoms: Depending  on the venom characteristics (neurotoxic, proteolytic etc.). 

Patient can have local effects like pain and tenderness, swelling, bleeding or blistering. Bleeding can be localized or diffuse. Some venoms can kill tissue around the site of the bite, and internal organs can be involved

Nervous systems effects: locally close to the bite area or affect nervous system directly (stopping breathing muscles). Initially victims may have vision problem, speaking and breathing problems and numbness close to or distant to the bite site.

Muscle death: necrosis or rhabdomyolysis.

Eyes: direct eye pain and damage with venom in eyes.

A rare complication in very swollen limbs is compartment syndrome.",
First Aid for Snake Bites,"<b>First aid for snake bites</b>
Immediately move away from the area where the bite occurred. If the snake is still attached use a stick or tool to make it let go. Sea snake victims need to be moved to dry land to avoid drowning.

Remove anything tight from around the bitten part of the body (e.g.: rings, anklets, bracelets) as these can cause harm if swelling occurs.

Reassure the victim. Many snake bites are caused by non-venomous snakes. And even after most venomous snake bites the risk of death is not immediate.

Immobilize the person completely. Splint the limb to keep it still. Use a makeshift stretcher to carry the person to a place where transport is available to take them to a health facility.

Never use a tight arterial tourniquet.

The Australian Pressure Immobilization Bandage (PIB) Method is only recommended for bites by neurotoxic snakes that do not cause local swelling.

Applying pressure at the bite site with a pressure pad may be suitable in some cases.

Avoid traditional first aid methods, herbal medicines and other unproven or unsafe forms of first aid.

Transport the person to a hospital.
 
<b>Management before or during transport.</b>
At the time of a bite, the cornerstone of care is complete immobilization of the affected body part and prompt transfer to a medical facility. 

Tourniquets and cutting wounds can worsen the effects of the venom and should not be used as first aid. 

Additional measures include keeping bitten limb lower than heart, wound cleansing to decrease infection risk, supportive therapy such as airway support, and administration of tetanus vaccine upon discharge if the person has been adequately vaccinated against tetanus (WHO).
 
Improving the clinical outcomes for the victims of snake bite needs much more than just access to safe antivenoms. Intravenous access should be achieved early, hydration state determined and corrected if needed, and vital signs must be closely monitored. Paracetamol may be given for local pain (which can be severe). 

Vomiting may occur, so place the person on their left side in the recovery position. Closely monitor airway and breathing and be ready to resuscitate if necessary.
 
<b>Contraindicated</b> .
Cutting into the bite site can damage underlying organs, increase the risk of infection, and sucking on the bite site does not result in venom removal.

Do NOT use ice. Ice does not deactivate the venom and can cause frostbite.

Do NOT use electric shocks. The shocks are not effective and could cause burns or electrical problems to the heart.

Do NOT use alcohol. Alcohol may deaden the pain, but it also makes the local blood vessels bigger, which can increase venom absorption.

Do NOT use tourniquets or constriction bands. These have not been proven effective, may cause increased tissue damage, and could cost the victim a limb.
 
<b>Extra note</b>
Antivenom can also cause serum sickness within 5-10 days of therapy. Serum sickness causes fevers, joint aches, itching, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, but it is not life-threatening.
 
In asymptomatic patients (bites without signs of envenomation and with normal coagulation), monitoring must continue for at least 12 hours , 24 hours preferred.
",
Management,"<b>Two or more of the following</b>*

Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula). 

Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnoea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia). 

Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence).

$Treatment And Diagnosis Codes,,
Importance of Coding,"Every single diagnosis and treatment must be given a code. The codes are written in the boxes to the right of where the diagnosis and treatment plans go.

There are multiple reasons why we require this information:
-Data analysis to plan for medication and equipment needs.
-Monitoring and Evaluation (impact of the organisation).
-Monitoring for any trends (e.g. disease outbreaks).
-Sharing data with local partners (Ministery of health).
-Application for public health grants.",
