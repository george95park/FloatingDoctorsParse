Do not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets. Don't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.

Antipyretics (eg, paracetamol and ibuprofen) should therefore not be used routinely but can be of value, especially for patients with systemic disease (particularly heart failure or respiratory failure) and when fever causes acute confusion. Consider either paracetamol or ibuprofen as an option if a child appears distressed or is unwell.\\nPharmacological Treatment (consult BNF or BNF for children)\\n\\nFirst line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen\\nSecond line: Ibuprofen\\n\\n** Please avoid maximum dosing where appropriate.
