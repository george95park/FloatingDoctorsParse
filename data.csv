$Introduction,,
General Guideline Principles,"<b>The following guidelines have been written, taking into account the local population and resources, most readily available to our organization. Whenever possible, the guidelines should be followed as written. However, patients should always be treated individually. At times it may be appropriate to stray from these guidelines: for individual patients or if specific resources are low.</b>

Please always ensure the patient is aware of the name and dosage of every medication prescribed. This will allow them to inform our doctors on future visits and/or continue to purchase as needed. This can easily be done using our Floating Doctors prescription pads (placing a script in with each bag of medications), please keep in mind all patients are not able to read written Spanish.
                                                                                                                               
If a patient is diagnosed with a chronic condition, requiring long-term medication, please fill in a Floating Doctors card for the patient. Details of the diagnosis, medication, blood pressure and blood sugar should be documented and the card given to the patient. The cards can be modified on future visits, depending on the treatment. The cards will allow the patient, and any doctor seeing the patient, to know what we are treating them for.

In clinic the British National Formulary (BNF) for adults and children will be available. Please use to BNF to check any medications you are not familiar with using, particularly side effects and contraindications (for example in breast feeding and pregnancy) as they are not all listed in these guidelines.

The following guidelines cover the treatment of the most common presentations that will be seen in our clinics. As you will discover, practicing medicine in a remote setting requires a different approach. The following guidelines were written with evidence based medicine, as well as, what is practically available and possible in our setting. 

Please discuss patients with our Lead Medical Providers, who have experience treating patients in our unique setting. Even relatively common conditions may be treated differently in our setting for a variety of reasons. The Lead Medical providers are there to ensure that the treatment each of our patients receives, meets Floating Doctors' standards. Treatment plans may differ between the communities also, depending on the local resources and closest health care facilities.

$Common Presentations,,
2.1 Fever,,
Presentation,"Usually present with subjective fever that can be taken as genuine in this setting.

Temperature > 38 Degrees Celsius.

Chills, rigors, sepsis.",
Causes,"Although the fever is frequently of viral origin, serious illness must be excluded [1]
    - Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection
    - Pneumonia.
    - Pyelonephritis.
    - Dengue.
    - Malaria (less likely).
    - Bacterial meningitis.
    - Skin infections.
    - Malignancy.
    - Vasculitis/Autoimmune disorders.",
Investigations,"Full intake, including Blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate.

Establish pattern and duration of fever.

History - review of systems. Examination - each organ system.

For children:
    - Check skin, throat, ears and lungs for source.
    - Ask about GI symptoms and seizures.
    - Urine dipstick test.",
Diagnosis,"Temperature >38 degrees Celsius.

Axillary temperature underestimates core body temperature by approximately 0.5 degrees Celsius. [2] 

0.5 degrees Celsius will be added to any axillary measurements at intake.",
General Management,"Infants (aged 0-28 days)
“All febrile neonates aged 0-28 days old should be hospitalized for presumed sepsis and treated with antibiotics pending culture results (48 hours)."" [3,4]

Infants (aged 28-90 days)
“All febrile infants aged 28-60 days, after having a sepsis evaluation, should be hospitalized and empirically started on intravenous antibiotics pending culture results.” [3]

Infants aged 28-90 days will require a number of investigations for which hospitalization is necessary. 

Regardless of hospitalization outcome, these children still require follow-up every 24 hours until the fever has resolved and all cultures are negative."" [5]

Infants (aged 3 months-3 years)
“Febrile children aged 3 months to 3 years are evaluated based on epidemiologic and focal findings revealed during the history taking and physical examination as well as whether or not these children are at low risk for serious bacterial infections."" [3,6]

Identification and appropriate management depends on the underlying cause. In the case of self-limiting viral infections, the only management required is advice and reassurance.

If meningococcal disease is suspected, give parenteral antibiotics at the earliest opportunity (Ceftriaxone - see essential medications for doses) and urgent evacuation to a hospital.

Health Education for patients and relatives:
Stress importance of adequate, and increased fluid intake.

Do not wear too many clothes or use too many blankets.

Don't wipe the sweat off immediately as this helps to cool the body.

Cool baths and tepid sponging are not recommended.

",
Treatment,"Child:
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen: 15 mg/kg every 8 hours as needed. 

(2nd line - Ibuprofen. 1-2 months: 5 mg/kg every 8 hours as needed, >2 months: 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours as needed).

Adult:
Paracetamol 500mg – 1g every 6 - 8 hours as needed (Maximum 4g/24 hours). 

(2nd line: Ibuprofen 200 – 400 mg every eight hours as needed).
",
Notes on NSAIDs,"Higher dosing of NSAIDs is not recommended in this region due to chronic dehydration and renal impairment.

Don't use Ibuprofen/aspirin in pregnant/breastfeeding women and avoid in those with peptic ulcer disease. 

Avoid Ibuprofen in children with fever and skin lesions, a rare adverse effect is worsening of skin lesions in chicken pox, which can be very serious. Paracetamol is the drug of choice.

,,
2.2 Headache,,
Causes,"In our setting one of the most common causes is dehydration [1]. Awareness of this and advice to patients to increase oral intake is therefore vital.

Other causes include, but are not limited to [2]:

Primary Headache
    - Tension
    - Migraine
    - Cluster headache

Secondary Headache
   - The list of causes of secondary headaches is exhaustive and can be found elsewhere [1,3]. It is included but not limited to: meningitis, giant cell arteritis, sinusitis and visual problems.",
Investigations,"History
    - Establish patient’s normal fluid intake. Most of population drink only 1-3 glasses of water a day, often while working in the sun!
    - A good history is critical to the diagnosis and management of headache. Particular attention must be paid to red flags [4]:
        - New onset headache.
        - Onset after age 50 years.
        - Change in pattern of headache.
        - Worsening headache.
        - Acute or sudden onset.
        - Sudden onset during exertion, with coughing, with sneezing, sex-related.
        - Headache with postural link (worse after lying down could be a sign of intracranial hypertension).
        - Headache in a setting of malignancy or HIV.
        - Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, cough).
        - Neurologic symptoms or signs.

Exam
- Normal intake will be performed. In case of red flags, ensure a full neurological exam is performed - including fundoscopy (to rule out papilloedema).",
Diagnosis,"Whilst access to investigations during Floating Doctors’ clinics will be somewhat limited, a simple history and examination will be ascertain the cause in most scenarios.

If any red flags or concerning features are elicited, please discuss with a Lead Medical Provider. Depending on the urgency of the situation, we can:
    - Arrange an emergency hospital appointment.
    - Attempt to expedite secondary care at a later date.",
Management,"1. Simple Dehydration Headache/Tension Headache
    - Check lying and standing BP (if postural symptoms).
Health Education [5]
    - Encourage ways to increase fluid intake (i.e., coconut juice, filtered/boiled water, soups, fruit, vegetables).
    - Explain importance of water in body.
    - Advise reduction of caffeinated beverages.
    - Explain that as a gross marker when urine is clear, they have drank enough water.

Pharmacological Treatment
     - First line: Paracetamol/Acetaminophen 500mg - 1g as needed every 6 - 8 hours (maximum 4g/24hrs). 
     - Advise only to take after they have drank 1 litre of water and if they still have the headache.

2. Migraines [5,6]
Health Education
    - Advice about triggers (i.e., coffee, cheese, stress).
    - Encourage a symptom diary where the patient can recognize their triggers.

Pharmacological Treatment
    - Acute: Combination of an NSAID and an antiemetic (i.e., ibuprofen 200 - 400 mg and metoclopramide 10mg).
    - Chronic: Regular prophylactic medication can be considered if the patient is having more than 2 migraines per month[5,6,7]. Assess for contraindications or cautions for B-blockers (if not contraindicated by asthma, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease or depression).
        - First line: Atenolol 50 mg once a day.
        - Second line: Amitriptyline 12.5mg once at night, increase to 25 mg if tolerated.
        
Other causes of headache can include; sinusitis, neck pathology, dental pathology, and otitis media. Always look for red flags for dengue (if current outbreak), meningitis, malaria (if patient has been to endemic region), space occupying lesions and intracranial bleeds.

Any concerns the headache is not a simple dehydration headache, ensure a full neurological examination including fundoscopy, in a dark room, is performed (to rule out papilloedema). Discuss cases with the floating LMP.

2.3 Musculoskeletal Pain,,
Causes,"“Musculoskeletal pain is a known consequence of repetitive strain, overuse, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. These injuries include a variety of disorders that cause pain in bones, joints, muscles, or surrounding structures. The pain can be acute or chronic, focal or diffuse. Low back pain is the most common example of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Other examples include tendonitis and tendinosis, neuropathies, myalgia, and stress fractures [1].”",
Presentation,"- Many patients describe a long history of generalized muscular pain, worse after work.
- Knee pain tends to be due to osteoarthritis.
- Back pain tends to be due to poor posture, particularly when lifting heavy objects.
- Shoulder and elbow pain tends to be from repetitive use (with machete or washing clothes).",
Investigations,"History
    - A thorough history can often elucidate a likely cause. Exclude history of direct trauma, deformity, or acute pathology (ongoing infection/ septic joint).
    - For back pain, pay particular attention to red flag features [1,2]:
        - Thoracic pain.
        - Age of onset less than 20 or more than 55 years.
        - Loss of control of the bowel or bladder.
        - Weakness or numbness in a leg or arm.
        - Foot drop, disturbed gait.
        - High fever.
        - Saddle anaesthesia (numbness of the anus, perineum or genitals, ask about sensation when wiping).
        - History of carcinoma.
        - Structural deformity.

Examination
    - Depending on the affected joint, it is necessary to perform a focused examination to guide management and follow up.
    - If back pain is associated with bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anaesthesia, a perform a DRE/PR [3]. 
    - Similarly, neurological examination can be useful if a patient has neurological symptoms.",
Management,"Health Education [4]
- Give appropriate exercises and stretches.
 
- Physiotherapy can be extremely beneficial.

- Heat packs made with a cloth and warm water.

- Advice on posture, moving, and handling techniques.

- Reassurance that muscular pain is normal after hard work and it tends to subside with time. 

- Advise them to return to next clinic or seek further medical advice if needed.

- Weight Loss where appropriate (overweight with osteoarthritis in lower limb joints).

Pharmacological Treatment:

Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain.
- Paracetamol/Acetaminophen 500mg - 1g as needed every 6-8 hours (4g/24hrs maximum).
    
Acute Musculoskeletal Pain/Inflammation.
- Ibuprofen 200 - 400 mg three times a day as needed. 
(NOT FOR REPEAT PRESCRIPTIONS, see side effects and contraindications of NSAIDs).

Neuropathic pain (This could be diabetic neuropathy or a condition such as sciatica).
- Amitriptyline 12.5 mg at night, increased after a week to 25mg.

Also see section on joint injections if appropriate.

If any alarming symptoms are elicited, hospital work-up either as an inpatient (in emergencies) or as an outpatient can be facilitated.

2.4 Intra-articular Joint Injections,,
Indications,"Indications for Intra-articular Joint Injection include:
- Arthritis.
- Bursitis.
- Tendinopathy.
- Tenosynovitis.
- Enthesopathy.",
Potential Complications,"- Hypersensitivity – local or systemic.

- Tissue atrophy, nodule formation and skin hypopigmentation.

- Tendon Rupture.

- Infection, local or systemic.

- Post injection flare of symptoms - usually short lived up to 48 hrs.

- Facial flushing – usually 24-72 hours post injection and predominantly women.

- Menstrual irregularity.

- Elevated blood sugar in diabetic patients.

- Fainting.

- Steroid induced osteonecrosis or arthropathy.
",
Contraindications,"- Known Allergy. 

- Local or systemic infection.

- Active rash / broken skin at site of injection.

- Uncontrolled Coagulopathy.

- Fracture/unstable joint.

- Tendon regions at high risk of rupture. 

- Injection into a prosthetic joint.
",
General Approach,"Informed consent (below) - most important report signs of infection urgently.

Screen for any contraindications. 

Draw up local anaesthetic and steroid and discard needle(s).

Attach new sterile needle(s).

Mark site (e.g. using needle cover). N.b. Injecting through ink risks tattooing skin.

Clean area with appropriate topical antiseptic.

Aspirate pre-injection to ensure vessel not entered.

Inject using no touch technique (unless full sterility observed).

See online video links below for techniques for shoulder, knee and elbow injections.

Cover site with sterile dressing.

The patients should be advised to remain in clinic for 20 minutes post injection.

Relative rest for 24 to 48 hours post injection, particularly if the knee is injected.

Review patient at 24 – 48 hours.

Warn patient about steroid flare of symptoms (usually short lived up to 48 hrs) & advise patient it may be up to 5 days before benefit noted.
",
Use of Local Anaesthetic,"Immediate relief from the anaesthetic as evidence of good placement of the injection.

Decrease the propensity of the glucocorticoid to cause atrophy.

Decrease glucocorticoid crystals acting as irritant or pro-inflammatory factor (so-called post injection flare) before the biochemical effect of the glucocorticoid takes over.
",
Video Links,"Shoulder

Elbow
Lateral epicondylitis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTgKsYeGe-4
(consider pinching up the skin over the epicondyle to minimise risk of atrophy or dimpling here as often quite a tight area)
",
Consent,The patient should be informed about the relevant risks and benefits of the injection. The clinician should document that such a discussion has taken place and that the patient has consented to the treatment.,
Complications,"Infection Risks
A rare complication of joint and soft tissue injection.  Hand mediated transmission is the major factor contributing to healthcare associated infection. Patient skin preparation is recommended prior to surgical procedures to reduce risk of infection.  However, the absence of skin prep in clinic should not be considered an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a joint injection. Before skin preparation, the skin should be free of visible dirt. The skin preparation should be applied in concentrically enlarging circles beginning at the site of proposed injection. Alcohol based, chlorhexidine based and iodine based preparation are all suitable.

Tendon Rupture
There have been case reports of tendon rupture following steroid injection and ingestion. Biopsy studies have demonstrated reduced cell viability and proliferation, reduced collagen synthesis and organisation, and reduced strength as a result of tendon exposure to steroid. Therefore, it is generally best to avoid injecting steroid into the body of a tendon and, unless strongly indicated, avoid steroid injections in the vicinity of tendons at high risk of rupture due to pathology (severe tendinopathy) or anatomical location (Achilles).

Osteonecrosis
The risk of osteonecrosis is highest with prolonged, high doses of exogenous steroids, particularly in the presence of other risk factors. Short courses of steroids however have also been shown to increase the risk of this rare complication.

Anticoagulation and joint injection
If the INR <4.5 then it is generally considered safe to proceed as bleeding risks are very low. However, it is unlikely the patient will have had a recent INR so you may need to refer the patient to a specialist or for an INR or consider other treatment options. Analgesia options are often limited in these patients. The decision to do these injections in patients who are anti-coagulated requires careful consideration. The risk of halting anticoagulation is often higher than the small risk of bleeding complications, but this should always be weighed. A management plan in the event of bleeding should be discussed with the patient in advance. We have few patients receiving warfarin treatment.

Steroid Type and Frequency
Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone are the two injectable steroids commonly available to Floating Doctors. There have been some suggestion of cartilage damage after steroid injection but no definitive evidence. Systematic Reviews (Stevens et al and Douglas 2012) have both concluded similarly, the frequency of injections should be guided by clinical diagnosis, treatment aims, professional opinion and experience. UpToDate provides more recent evidence (Oct 2018) advising against serial steroid injections due to concerns about potential negative effects on cartilage and disease progression; no number is cited as being safe of unsafe.

Menstrual Irregularity & Cushing’s Syndrome
Systemic absorption of steroid has been shown to affect the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after steroid joint injections. This can last up to four weeks after a single injection, occasionally longer, depending on the dose and frequency of injections. This is the mechanism thought to affect menstruation.   Rare cases of Cushing’s syndrome have been reported but generally using unusually high doses and frequencies. HIV patients on antiretrovirals are more susceptible to iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. Careful consideration should be given to this complication if multiple or repeat steroid injections are going to be undertaken. 

Soft tissue atrophy
This is an uncommon complication of steroid injection even in superficial dermatological procedures involving steroid injection.
Hyperglycaemia – Intra-articular steroid injections have been shown to elevate blood sugar in diabetic patients, starting after a few hours and lasting for several days, sometimes longer. These increases in glycaemia are statistically significant but for most patients not clinically significant. However, diabetic patients should be warned of this effect. 

Anaphylaxis
According to the resuscitation council UK website, the time course for cardiopulmonary arrest resulting from injected medication predominantly occurs between 2- 20 minutes post injection. Patients should be asked to stay for the full 20 minutes.

2.5 Rash,,
Presentation,"Patients, typically children, present with acute or chronic rashes. Often these are nonspecific and the underlying diagnosis can seem unclear.",
Causes,"Common types of skin rash that we encounter include:
    - Scabies.
    - Impetigo.
    - Seborrhoeic dermatitis.
    - Folliculitis.
    - Insect bites.
    - Cutaneous leishmaniasis.

It is important to be aware that skin rash can be due to more sinister causes [1]. These include meningococcal disease, malignancy, non-accidental injury or TB.",
Investigations,"Children in the communities are usually fully vaccinated, and often the mothers will have a card to prove it. Thankfully this makes a lot of the more serious infections less likely. If you are in doubt regarding vaccinations as the mother for the child's card or ask the Lead Medical Provider if the community in question has a good vaccine program (some communities have less access than others unfortunately).",
Diagnosis,"History [2]
    - Past medical history, family history, occupation, hobbies, drugs.
    - Duration of lesions
    - Have there been previous episodes?
    - Does the lesion persist or change?
    - Where is/are the lesion(s) (check mucous membranes)?
    - Provoking or relieving factors
    - Associated symptoms: Itch, tenderness, bleeding or discharge, systemic symptoms
    - Has patient previously received treatment?

Examination
Do a thorough examination. If required, consider using the private room.

The diagram below may help with diagnosis

(PICTURE)

Taken from [3]

Another option is to take a photograph of the lesion (provided the patient/ family consent) that can be uploaded to SERMO for secondary advice.",rash_diagnosis
Management,"This will vary depending on the underlying cause.

To see if the started treatment is effective you can ask the patient to return to the Friday Follow-Up on single-day clinics (or Thursday morning on multi-day clinics). Special therapies may be acquired and brought back during Follow-Up if they aren't ones we stock regularly.

Health Education
A high proportion of the cases we see will be infective. Therefore, measures to prevent spread can be useful. These include [2,4]:
    - Hand washing.
    - Please hand soap to the patient.
    - Avoidance of itching.
    - Use a tissue, or cough and sneeze into your arm, not your hand. Turn away from other people.

Pharmacological
Eczematous/Dermatitis Rash. 
  - First line: Emollient/moisturiser. 
    (Coconut oil (aceite de coco), Calamine lotion, Oatmeal bath, E45). 
  - Second line: Trial of Hydrocortisone 1%. 
    (Use cautiously if differential is fungal infection, can trial on small area of skin, if the rash gets worse then the patient must stop using).

Wounds/Superficial Secondary Bacterial Infections.
  - Clean the wound with clean water and soap and iodine.
  - Counsel the Patient regarding maintaining the wound and avoiding the ocean.
  - Do not use triple antibiotic cream (unless impetigo), supply iodine to the patient to take home with counselling on how to use.
  - If the infection needs antibiotic treatment, give antibiotics as per cellulitis or impetigo guidelines depending on the clinical presentation.

2.6 Dehydration,,
Presentation,"There are numerous signs and symptoms of dehydration. These include but are not limited to [1]:
    - Dry mouth/ lips.
    - Lack of tears.
    - Not keeping any fluid down.
    - Not making urine/ dry nappies.
    - Lethargic/ confused.",
Causes,"This maybe from working hours in the sun and not drinking sufficient water or exacerbated by a medical condition listed below [1]. 

Gastrointestinal
- Gastroenteritis 
- Other GI - Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, poor intake due to GI tract inflammation/infection (Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, oral/esophageal candidiasis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis) causing pain.

Endocrine
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 
- Diabetes insipidus: excessive output of very dilute urine. 
- Thyrotoxicosis: increased insensible losses and diarrhoea. 
- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

Febrile illness: fever causes increased insensible fluid losses. 

Burns: fluid losses may be extreme and require aggressive fluid management. 

Heat stroke. 

Cystic fibrosis: excessive sodium and chloride losses in sweat.",
Investigations,"Assess the level of dehydration.

(Photo)",dehydration_assessment
Management,"General Principles for Diarrhoea and Dehydration in infants/children [2-4]:

Tell carer to...

1. Give extra fluids.
- More frequent and longer duration of breastfeeding.
- If not exclusively breastfeeding or not taking the breast give ORS/SSS 10 ml/kg/hr or food with liquid content.
- After each loose stool give extra fluid.
- Up to 2 years: 50 to 100 ml after each loose stool 2 years or more: 100 to 200 ml after each loose stool.

2. Continue feeding
- Restart food as early as possible, good foods include banana, cereals, bread: avoid sugary foods.

3. Seek medical attention if...
- Dry mouth/lips.
- Lack of tears.
- Not keeping any fluid down.
- Not making urine/Dry nappies. Lethargic/confused.


If a child looks moderately dehydrated or you have any concerns... 

Give the child ORS in clinic and observe closely over 4 hours.
    - If patient not improving, then consider IV fluids or hospital admission. Ideally review patient again in 24 hours.


Give Zinc supplements OD 10 days (2 - 6 months: 10mg, 6 months–5 years: 20mg).
    - If available zinc decreases the length of diarrhoeal illness and decreases the recurrence of diarrhoeal illnesses [5].

Determine the amount of ORS to give in the first 4 hours [6] (20 ml/kg per hour)
     (View picture above)

If you are more concerned, options are:
    - Arrange hospital admission.
    - We have IV fluids which we can utilize in emergency situation.
    - Arrange for the patient to return for Friday Follow-Up.

ORS is best, or (clean) water, avoid sugary drinks. ORS is routinely available in clinics. However, a home remedy can be taught for the next time the patient has diarrhoea and/or dehydration.

Sugar Salt Solution (Home remedy) [5-7]
    - IL clean water (boiled)
    - ½ tsp salt
    - 6 tsp sugar

",dehydration_management
Complications,"Shock can result from hypoperfusion [2,3].

Arrange emergency transfer to secondary care [2]:
    - Pale or mottled skin.
    - Cold extremities.
    - Decreased level of consciousness.
    - Tachycardia/ Tachypnoea
    - Weak peripheral pulses.
    - Prolonged capillary refill time.

2.7 Malnutrition,,
Presentation,"Malnutrition refers to a nutrient deficiency state of protein, energy or micronutrients [1].

In adults, the Body Mass Index can be used to detect malnutrition. A BMI below 18.5 is classed as underweight [2]. Beware of solely using this to diagnose malnutrition however as oedema can mask weight loss in some circumstances [3]. Other signs in adults include [4]: somnolence, frequent infections, delayed wound healing and poor concentration.

For children, the WHO criteria for identifying children with severe malnutrition are [4,5]:
    - Bipedal oedema.
    - Visible severe wasting.
    - Weight for height more than three standard deviations below the median of international reference population.

Look for signs of the following 3 clinical syndromes (mixed pictures may occur) [6]:
    - “Marasmus: Obvious loss of weight with gross reduction in muscle mass, especially from limb girdles. Subcutaneous fat virtually absent. Thin, atrophic skin lies in folds. Alopecia and brittle hair. Sometimes, appearance of lanugo hair.
    - Kwashiorkor: Usually occurs in children aged 1-2 years with changing hair colour to red, grey or blonde. Moon facies, swollen abdomen (pot belly), hepatomegaly and pitting oedema. Dry, dark skin which splits were stretched over pressure areas, to reveal pale areas.
    - Nutritional dwarfism: Patient is small for age. Face shape may be affected by size of teeth.”",
Causes,"There are a number of risk factors that place individuals at a higher risk of malnutrition. These include [6,7]: extremely young age, poverty, coexisting chronic illness or developmental delay and mental health problems.",
Investigations,"Use Children Growth Charts to guide your diagnosis.
Calculate the patient’s Body Mass Index.
The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool screening tool can also be used to identify malnutrition risk [8]:

(View picture above)",malnutrition_investigations
Management,"General advice on the importance of nutritional intake is vital.

The provision of multivitamins in children boosts micronutrient intake [9] and can have positive effects on growth [10]. As such we routinely give multivitamins to all children.

The use of supplements is more useful than advice alone in the elderly [11]. From time to time we have Mannapack supplements. These can also be beneficial.

If children <5 are (severely) malnourished please consult a Lead Medical Provider about the option of Fundacion NutreHogar.",
Complications,"- “Impaired immune response and increased risk of infection.
- Reduced muscle strength.
- Impaired wound healing.
- Impaired psychosocial function, including poor cognition and increased dependency.
- Impaired recovery from illness and surgery.
- Poorer health outcomes.
- Poor quality of life”

3.1 Parasitic Skin infections,,
3.1.1 Scabies,,
Presentation,"Relatively common in the communities we visit. The most common symptoms of scabies, itching and a skin rash, are caused by sensitization (a type of “allergic” reaction) to the proteins and feces of the parasite. Severe itching (pruritus), especially at night, is the earliest and most common symptom of scabies. A pimple-like (papular) itchy (pruritic) “scabies rash” is also common. In this climate itching and rash may affect the whole body or be limited to common sites (between the fingers, wrist,elbow, armpit and penis). [1]",
Causes,"Scabies is an itchy rash caused by the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei [2].

Risk Factors are overcrowding, poverty, poor nutritional status, poor hygiene, children, immunocompromised individuals and elderly [3]. The elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are at particular risk of the crusted variant. They tend to present with clinically atypical lesions and are often misdiagnosed, causing a delay in appropriate treatment and increased risk of a local epidemic.

",
Investigations,The diagnosis is largely clinical. A magnifying lens may help in identification of burrows or even occasionally mites [4]. If in doubt the case can be posted with images on SERMO.,
Management,"- Treat whole family, where possible, wash bedding, hammocks and clothes in very hot water and leave to try in direct sunlight.
- Soap.
-The primary  method of treatment for scabies is by either oral anthelmintic (ivermectin), or topical application of a parasiticidal preparation (permethrin) overnight to the whole body from head to toe. Which agent to use is dependant on the weight of the patient, if the patient is pregnant or if the patient is breast feeding. Treatment is should be repeated a week later. If there is secondary bacterial infection present, this should be treated first with antibiotics for 24-48 hours in the case of permethrin to avoid systemic absorption.

- For Patients < 15kg, Pregnant or Breastfeeding (Ivermectin contraindicated in all three)
    - Permethrin cream 5% (for children over 2 months), applied to body on day 1 and day 8.
                        *Apply at night
                        *Avoid face.
                        *Advise wrap hands to avoid ingestion in infants. 
                        *Don't apply to broken/inflamed skin. 
                        *Treat secondary infection first with antibiotic for 24-48 hours.
                        *Do not apply after a hot bath (as this increases systemic absorption and removes the drug from its treatment site). 

- For Patients 15kg+
    - Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg once on day 1 and day 8.

Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies
-Ivermectin 200 mcg/Kg oral and Permethrin 5% cream if patient over 15kg and not pregnant or breastfeeding.
-Patients with crusted 'Norwegian' scabies may require two or three applications of permethrin on consecutive days to ensure that enough penetrates the hyperkeratotic areas to kill all the mites.
-Patients are often immunocompromised (consider Malnutrition, HIV etc).

[4,5]
The primary  method of treatment for scabies is by either oral anthelmintic (ivermectin), or topical application of a parasiticidal preparation (permethrin) overnight to the whole body from head to toe. This treatment is should be repeated a week later. If there is secondary bacterial infection present, this should be treated first with antibiotic cream for 24-48 hours.

<15kg (but over 2 months) or pregnant: Permethrin 5% dermal cream. Apply on day 1 and day 8.

15kg+ : Oral ivermectin 200 mcg/kg once on day 1 and repeated on day 8.

Crusted ‘Norwegian’ scabies (severe form):
If patient over 15kg, treat with both oral ivermectin 200 mcg/kg and topical permethrin 5% cream. 

Patients with crusted scabies may require two or three applications on consecutive days to ensure that enough penetrates the hyperkeratotic areas to kill all the mites.

",Ivermectin_dosing_table
Complications,"    - Secondary bacterial infection. Cellulitis, impetigo and abscesses may be the result, and bacterial skin infection can further predispose to invasive infection and sepsis.
    - Scabies can cause flaring or reactivation of eczema or psoriasis. Those whose immunity is highly sensitive can present with extensive dermatitis or even erythroderma.
    - Scabies has social stigma and may cause psychological harm with persistent delusions of parasitosis, shame or guilt. [4,5,6]",

3.1.3 Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,,
Presentation,"Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoan of the genus Leishmania [1]. The presentation of Leishmaniasis varies according to the species causing the infection and the region in the world where a person is infected. There are 3 main types of Leishmaniasis [2,3]:
    - Visceral
    - Cutaneous
    - Mucocutaneous

This section will focus on cutaneous Leishmaniasis since this is the type that is mainly present in Panama [2]. Lesions start mostly on exposed regions of the skin which are easily bitten by sandflies. The lesions start as erythematous patches that change to plaques and ulcers. Unless there is a secondary bacterial infection, the lesions are usually painless. Many patients have limited cutaneous lesions that self-cure within 6-18 months, leaving scarred tissue.",
Causes,"‘Scattered cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis occur in rural areas in the entire country, but most cases are reported from western Panama (Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui and Panama Provinces) and from the west-central areas [4].’

L. panamensis is responsible for the great majority of the cases, mostly in forested areas from west to east, including Bocas del Toro [5]. The two-toed sloth is the main reservoir [5,6].",
Diagnosis,"In cases where Leishmaniasis is suspected, consult with a Lead Medical Provider.

The diagnosis and treatment of Leishmaniasis can be provided free of charge through MINSA. For the diagnosis of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, parasitological testing is required [7]. The number of cases of diagnosed Cutaneous Leishmaniasis from 2009 is represented in the diagram above [8]:",cutaneous_diagnosis
Management,"The following considerations need to be made prior to referral for treatment
- Number, size, evolution and persistence of lesions, location of lesions (e.g. on the face), other features ie lymphangitis.

Local alternative treatments include 
- Heat treatment, cryotherapy, and topical amphotericin. 
- In these communities many lesions are treated with ‘local treatment’ which may or may not improve the underlying condition.

Medical treatment
- Treatment usually occurs in the closest Centro de Salud, based on clinical diagnosis and usually without monitoring of kidney or liver function. 
- Standard treatment in Panama is a course of IM Pentavalent Antimony for 21 days, which can cause reno-hepatotoxicity.
- We tend to treat secondary infections and advise and support patients to seek treatment if there are multiple lesions, lesions on the face, large lesions or worsening lesions. 
- As for smaller lesions, which will likely heal spontaneously, the risk of treatment may be larger than the risk of the lesions causing significant morbidity.

[9]
",
Complications,"The cutaneous form differs from the visceral variety and doesn’t transform to Visceral Leishmaniasis (except in rare cases of immunocompromise in HIV). In certain regions of Central and South America with the Vianna subspecies, 5% of the cutaneous form may develop into Mucocutaneous form (sometimes years after the initial infection), which typically affects the nasal mucosa and is destructive in nature. However, in our region of Panama this seems to be very rare, despite the most likely leishmania species being from the Vianna subspecies (L. Panamensis). [10]. 

Other complications of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis include [10,11]: bleeding, superimposed infections due to immunodeficiency and disfigurement.",

3.2 Bacterial infection,,
3.2.1 Cellulitis,,
Presentation,"“Cellulitis appears as a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot and tender. It can spread rapidly to other parts of the body. Cellulitis isn't usually spread from person to person.
Skin on lower legs is most commonly affected, though cellulitis can occur anywhere on your body or face.” [1]",
Causes,“The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus or Staphylococcus spp. but they can be caused by a wide range of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.” [2],
Investigations,"Usually the diagnosis is clinical and no investigations are required. If investigations are required, the ones likely to be of benefit will be in a hospital setting.
The basic vital signs and clinical examination can be utilised to inspect for clinical features of sepsis. [3]

Check vital signs to screen for sepsis.

Check random blood sugar as diabetes is a risk factor and uncontrolled blood sugar will affect healing.",
Management,"General measures include rest, elevation of any affected limbs, and analgesia (paracetamol or ibuprofen) [4]

1st line
Children >25kg - Adults:  Cloxacillin 10-14 days 500mg 4 times a day.
Children <25kg:  Amoxicillin 10-14 days.
1–4 years 250 mg 3 times a day. 5–11 years 500 mg 3 times a day.

If severe or not improving after 48-72 hours, then add in second line.

2nd line 
Children >25kg - Adults: Clindamycin 150–300 mg 4 times a day, 10-14 days.
Children <25kg: Azithromycin 5 days. 
6 months-17 years: 10 mg/kg once a day (max 500mg per dose). 
",
Complications,"Complications are uncommon but may include: abscess formation, gangrene, thrombophlebitis/lymphangitis, chronic leg oedema (a late complication which may predispose to further episodes of infection).

Less common complications (occurring in <1%) include: necrotising fasciitis, osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, septicaemia, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

For skin abscess, treatment is incision and drainage (earliest clinic day to enable one follow up) AND oral antibiotics.
Children >25kg - Adults: Clindamycin 150mg - 300mg 4 times a day for 5-7 days.
Children <25kg: Amoxicillin 5-7 days. 1-4 years 250 mg 3 times a day, 5-11 years 500mg 3 times a day.

10.2.2 Folliculitis,,
Presentation,"“Folliculitis is a common skin condition in which hair follicles become inflamed. It's usually caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. At first it may look like small red bumps or white-headed pimples around hair follicles — the tiny pockets from which each hair grows. The infection can spread and turn into non healing, crusty sores.
The condition isn't life-threatening, but it can be itchy, sore and embarrassing. Severe infections can cause permanent hair loss and scarring.” [171]",
Causes,"“Damaged follicles are at risk of infection. The most common causes of follicle damage are:
    - Friction from shaving or tight clothing
    - Heat and sweat, such as that caused by wearing rubber gloves or waders
    - Certain skin conditions, such as dermatitis and acne
    - Injuries to your skin, such as from scrapes or surgical wounds
    - Coverings on your skin, such as plastic dressings or adhesive tape” [172]",
Investigations,The diagnosis is based on history and examination findings.,
Management,"General Measures
    - Avoid precipitating factors such as inappropriate clothing.
    - Use separate washing implements and towels from other members of the household.

Pharmacological treatment
    - Mild, superficial folliculitis may resolve with hygiene measures and without medical treatment.
    - Treat deeper folliculitis as per cellulitis. [172,173]",

10.2.3 Impetigo,,
Presentation,"Impetigo is a very common superficial infection of the skin. It can be divided into non-bullous and bullous forms. The non-bullous types represent the majority of cases.

Non-bullous impetigo starts as tiny pustules or vesicles that evolve rapidly into crusted plaques that tend to be under 2 cm in diameter. It usually starts on the face or on the extremities where bites, scratches, burns or trauma have occurred. It spreads rapidly. Little or no surrounding erythema or oedema. Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged.
Bullous impetigo has a thin roof and tend to rupture spontaneously. They are usually on the face, trunk, extremities, buttocks, or perineal regions. More likely to occur on top of other disease like atopic eczema. [1]",
Causes,"Impetigo - In the UK Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism, Streptococcus pyogenes is the other pathogen involved, and on occasions both organisms can be found together. In warmer climates Streptococcus pyogenes is more prevalent.

Bullous impetigo - Is nearly always caused by Staphylococcus aureus. [2]",
Investigations,The diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical examination findings.,
Management,"General advice [3,4,5,6]
“Advise good hygiene measures to prevent spread (also to other people):
- Keep the affected area(s) clean and dry
- Wash hands after touching affected area(s).
- Avoid sharing of towels and bathwater.
- Avoid scratching the affected area. Keep fingernails short and clean.” Children can use mittens to prevent scratching.
 
Localised impetigo:
- Soap and water twice a day.
- Triple antibiotic cream 2 - 3 times a day for 3 - 5 days.

Complicated / Widespread / Severe Impetigo:

1st line: 
Children >25kg - Adults: Cloxacillin 500mg 4 times a day, 5-7 days.
Children <25kg: Amoxicillin 5-7 days.
1–4 years 250 mg 3 times a day. 5–11 years 500 mg 3 times a day.

Review 48 - 72 hours, if not improving switch or add in second line if very severe.

Second line: Azithromycin 3 days. 
6 months - 17 years: 10 mg/kg once a day (max/adult dose 500mg once a day).

10.3 Fungal Skin Infections,,
10.3.1 Dermatophytes,,
Presentation,"“Dermatophytosis (tinea) infections are fungal infections caused by dermatophytes. They tend to grow outwards on skin, producing a ring-like pattern - hence the term 'ringworm'. They are very common here in Panama and affect different parts of the body.”

According to site:
    - Scalp - tinea capitis.
    - Feet - tinea pedis.
    - Hands - tinea manuum.
    - Nail - tinea unguium (or onychomycosis).
    - Beard area - tinea barbae.
    - Groin - tinea cruris.
    - Body including trunk and arms - tinea corporis.

[1]
",
Causes,"Infection is limited to the dead layers of skin but encouraged by a damp and warm local environment like her in Panama. The infection can also be transmitted between people, from soil and from animals. [2]",
Differential Diagnosis,"Eczema and psoriasis are commonly confused with tinea. 
Pityriasis versicolor occurs all over the trunk while candida occurs as a flexural rash at extremes of age or in the immunocompromised, those with diabetes or patients on antibiotics.

If in doubt, take a picture (with the patient’s consent) and post the case on SERMO. This opens up the clinical situation to a number of specialists. [3,4]
",
Management,"Tinea Corporis:
1st line: Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3 times a day. Continue for 1-2 weeks after lesions have disappeared.   

Consider 2nd line at next clinic in case of treatment failure.        

2nd line: Griseofulvin 4-6 weeks. 
Children <12: 10 mg/kg (max 500mg) once a day.
Children >12 - Adults: 500mg daily for 6 weeks.

Tinea Capitis:
Shave head if appropriate, clean with soap and water twice a day. Examine whole family as scalp ringworm is contagious. 
Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3 times a day    AND   Griseofulvin 4-6 weeks (dose as above)


Tinea Pedis
Keep feet clean and dry as much as possible (After each use of boots if used).
Treat with clotrimazole 1% cream BD for 4-6 weeks if severe.

[5,6,7,8]
",
Complications,"The main complication is secondary bacterial infection.
Hair loss is a complication of tinea capitis. Tinea capitis can develop into kerion (boggy deeper scalp infection). [9]",

10.3.2 Candidiasis,,
Presentation,"Candidiasis often presents with soreness and itching.

Depending on the different forms of cutaneous candidiasis the appearance may vary:
    - Red, moist skin area, possibly pustules or papules, yellow-white scale on the surface (looks like curds).

There are different forms of cutaneous candidiasis, the most frequent:
    - Intertrigo (skin fold infection).
    - Candidal nail infections - chronic paronychia or onychomycosis.
    - Napkin dermatitis.
    - Balanitis.
    - Mucocutaneous candidiasis.
    - Candidal folliculitis.

[1]",
Causes,"The following factors increase the likelihood of candidiasis occurring [1,2]:
    - Irritated or damaged skin
    - Patients taking antibiotics
    - Poorly controlled diabetes
    - Immunodeficiency e.g. HIV
    - Menopause
    - Pregnancy",
Investigations,"In our clinical setting, access to investigations is limited. Diagnosis will be clinical based on the patient’s clinical presentation. If you are in doubt, liaise with a Lead Medical Provider. If you are still struggling consider adding the case to SERMO.",
Management,"General measures: 
Avoid occlusion of skin, avoid obesity, keep skin dry, expose area to air when appropriate, wash with emollients as soap substitutes and dry thoroughly after washing.

Pharmacological treatment:
Clotrimazole 1% cream twice per day - Continue until 1 week after lesions have disappeared
If there is problematic itch or inflammation, consider adding a mild corticosteroid cream (Hydrocortisone cream) for 7-14 days.
Consider systemic oral treatment with fluconazole 50mg/day or fluconazole 150mg once weekly for 2-4 weeks if: topical treatment is ineffective, there is widespread infection or if the patient is immunocompromised.

Nappy rash: Apply zinc oxide for 2-3 weeks. If severe treat with clotrimazole cream 1%, 2-3 times a day for 7 days.

Oral candidiasis: Oral nystatin 7 days. 
Child 1 month-1 year: 200,000 IU 4 times a day.
Children 2-17 years: 400,000 IU 4 times a day.
Adults 600,000 IU 4 times a day.

Vaginal candidiasis - see urogynaecology section.
",
Complications,"Invasive candidiasis can develop. This term encompasses the conditions candidaemia and deep-seated tissue candidiasis. If you suspect either of these conditions, urgent admission to hospital is necessary. [4]",

10.3.3 Tinea Skin Infections,,
Presentation,"Pityriasis versicolor
- Macular lesions and patches of altered pigmentation are seen primarily on the trunk.
These lesions frequently spread to the neck, upper arms and abdomen and can sometimes occur at other sites. The face may be affected in children. There is a superficial scale which is best seen by stretching the affected skin, or scraping the surface. 

Ringworm 
- Commonly affects the scalp (mainly in children), but can be anywhere on the body. Usually one (can be more) round, scaly erythematous plaques, with clear ring at border. Can develop into kerion (boggy deeper scalp infection).

[1]",
Causes,"Relatively common in hot, humid climates. Pityriasis has an estimated prevalence around 30-40%. Most infections occur in normal healthy people but the following factors increase the risk:
    - Hyperhidrosis or increased physical activity causing sweating.
    - Occlusive clothes, dressings or ointments.
    - Immunosuppression or immune deficiency.
    - Malnutrition.
[2]",
Investigations,"The diagnosis is most often clinical in our setting. The main differential is Pityriasis Alba, which is a post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, so best to take a good history of recent skin problems (infections/erythema/scaling). Consult with a Lead Medical Provider if in doubt. An alternative option is to post the case on SERMO should you be unsure. ",
Management,"Pityriasis Versicolor
- First line: Clotrimazole 1% cream 2 times a day for 4 weeks.

       If first line treatment fails, then review diagnosis and treat with second line if appropriate.

-Second line: Fluconazole 150mg, weekly for 2-4 weeks (adults)

Tinea capitis
- Shave head if appropriate, clean with soap and water twice a day. 
- Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3 times a day     AND
- Griseofulvin 4-6 weeks. 
            Children <12:  10 mg/kg (max 500mg) once a day. Children >12-Adults: 500mg daily.

Tinea Corporis
- 1st line: Clotrimazole 1% cream 2-3 times a day.  

      Consider 2nd line at next clinic in case of treatment failure.        

- 2nd line: Griseofulvin 4-6 weeks. 
     Children <12:  10 mg/kg (max 500mg) once a day. Children >12-Adults: 500mg daily for 6 weeks.

*Examine whole family as scalp ringworm is contagious.

Athlete’s foot
- Keep feet clean and dry as much as possible (After each use of boots if used).
- Treat with clotrimazole 1% cream twice a day for 4-6 weeks if severe.


[3]
",
Complications,"Recurrence is very common.
Hypopigmentation of the skin can persist for months after treatment.

10.3.4 Wound Care,,
Presentation,"Patients knowledge of wound care is generally poor in this area. Initially assess the wound and the need for closure. Assess [1,2,3] the mode of injury, time of injury, type of wound, location (proximity to major vessels and nerves), shape of the wound, depth and direction. Also check to for the presence of a potential foreign body and for underlying structural injury.

The next step is to achieve haemostasis [4]. This can be spontaneous but may require pressure or elevation. Do not use a tourniquet.[4,5]

",
Cleaning and Suturing,"Please be aware of the fact that often the patient will be in a lot of pain! Analgesia is therefore essential.

In case needed use lidocaine as a local anaesthetic [4,5] (up to 3 mg/kg. NB: a 1% solution contains 10 mg/mL). E.g. If a patient weighs 70 kg, use no more than 210mg. This would be 21 ml of lidocaine 1%.

The next step is to clean the area extensively and remove debris. Use saline 0.9% where possible [6]. If this is not available, use tap water. Tap water has been shown to have as low, or lower, infection rates as proprietary antiseptic solutions [7].

Wound Closure - The timing of wound closure will be based on your assessment of the wound [6,7]:
    - Primary closure: immediate closure can be used for simple wounds <12 hours old with opposable edges. Delayed primary closure: if there is high risk of infection, give prophylactic antibiotics and close after a few days provided there is no infection. This is something that can be done on a follow up day if planned appropriately.
    - Secondary closure: allow the wound to close by itself if a bite (except on the face) or it has separated edges or infection. This may result in increased scarring.


Type of Closure [6,7,8]
    - If primary closure is decided upon, generally we have 3 options available: steristrips, tissue adhesives and/or sutures. Bear in mind that sutures will need to be removed. Often this can be problematic in our setting so if this option is chosen an appropriate removal plan is essential.
    - Steristrips can be used for small wounds or to allow for drainage where needed.
    - For small superficial lacerations, consider the use of tissue adhesives [12] if available.
    - If sutures are used, advise regarding appropriate follow up. Teach patient or carer to remove sutures in a hygienic way if follow up is not possible. Another option is to consult with a Lead Medical Provider or the Clinic Manager. In some clinic locations there are health workers who are trained to remove sutures. Ensuring that these health workers follow up the wound care after we're gone can be useful.

",
"Dressings, Antibiotics and Follow Up","The following guidelines provide a rough idea of when sutures should be removed [2,4]:
    - Face: 4 - 5 days
    - Neck: 7 days
    - Arms and back of hands: 7 days
    - Scalp, chest, abdomen or back: 7 - 10 days
    - Legs and top of feet: 10 days
    - Palms, soles, fingers or toes: 12 - 14 days
    - Overlying a joint: 12 - 14 days

Contaminated wounds such as dog bites are best left open initially IF adequate follow up is likely to be available. 
- However if not, irrigate the wound extensively, close the wound and start antibiotics (Clindamycin 150 – 300 mg 3 times a day for 5 - 7 days). 
- Clean area extensively (use clean water).
- Remove debris.
- Use appropriate dressing gauze and compression bandage if needed        
- Explain clearly wound care highlighting importance of clean water/dressing, keeping wound dry, changing dressing if gets wet, daily review and signs of poor healing/infection. if gets wet, daily review and signs of poor healing/infection.

Dressings [11]
    - “The first layer in contact with the wound surface should be non-adherent - eg, a lightly lubricated gauze with interstices.
    - Occlusive dressings can lead to maceration with retained fluid.
    - The next layer should be absorbent material to attract any wound exudate.
    - Finally, soft gauze rolls tape can be used to secure the initial materials in place.
    - Dressings may not be necessary if the wound is dry and extra protection is not required.”
[13,11].

 - Whilst rabies is relatively rare, there have been some cases reported in Panama [12]. For all dirty wounds (e.g. animal bites or those involving metals), refer the patient to hospital for tetanus vaccination if the patient is not uptodate [13], the CDC recommends a booster every 10 years.",

    - Nasal discharge/ obstruction
    - Sneezing
    - Sore throat
    - General malaise
    - Cough
    - Hoarseness, loss of taste and smell, mild burning of the eyes and a feeling of pressure in the ears or sinuses, due to obstruction and/or mucosal swelling, may also occur. Headache and fever tend to be less common symptoms.",
Causes,"Adults
    - Allergic versus nonallergic rhinitis.
    - Pharyngitis.
    - Influenza.
    - Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever).

Children
    - In addition to the above list, consider a foreign body in the nose. The discharge is unilateral, purulent, foul-smelling and blood-stained.

Infants
    - Consider the possibility of more serious conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia.",
Management,"Health Education
- Reassure parents and advise to increase fluid intake.
- Advise patients/ families about the usual course of the illness. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that the average total length of illness is 10 days.
- Antibiotic treatment of URTI does not alter the outcome of the illness or prevent further complications [4]. Explain that antibiotics may also have side-effects - eg, diarrhoea, vomiting and rash.
- Advise on hygiene measures.
- We do not use cough remedies.

Acute (Sino)rhinitis    
- Antibiotics are not effective for purely viral infections.
- Reassure parents and advise to increase fluid intake.
- Treat fever if distressing/symptomatic/>38 degrees celsius.
- Counsel regarding hydration.

- Amoxicillin 1g every 8 hours for 10 - 14 days. 
- Second line - erythromycin.",
4.1.2 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection - Acute Pharyngitis,,
Presentation,"Common to all pharyngitis (bacterial or viral) 
- Throat pain and pain on swallowing +/- fever 
- Erythematous or exudative pharynx/ tonsils

Specific to different types of pharyngitis
- Vesicular: blisters or ulcers on tonsils or pharynx. Always viral, usually coxsackie or herpes viruses
- Pseudomembranous: red throat with grey or white membrane over tonsils- consider diphtheria (check vaccination status) 
- Patients >14 years of age: GAS pharyngitis uncommon. Consider Infectious Mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr Virus in adolescents and young people with associated lethargy, adenopathy and splenomegaly. Pharyngitis in older age group can also be due to gonococcal infection or primary HIV infection (take a sexual history). 
- Stridor is not usually a feature of isolated pharyngitis as it represents upper airway obstruction. In children consider croup or epiglottitis (especially in unvaccinated as causative organism is H. Influenza). 
- GAS: more commonly have anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, palatal petechiae, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. Children may also present with a widespread rash and ‘strawberry’ tongue known as Scarlet fever. 
",
Complications,"All types of pharyngitis can result in the following complications:
- Sepsis, mastoiditis, peritonsillitis abscess, retropharyngeal abscess- give IM/IV antibiotics and consider referral to hospital for further management. 
- Otitis media (common). 
- Deviation of uvula.
- Change in voice.
- Dehydration (particularly in young children due to throat pain)- perform oral fluid challenge in clinic.
",
Treatment,"Treatment aims to provide symptomatic relief and prevent complications in those who are high risk. All patients should be advised to take regular paracetamol, adequate oral fluids and practice hand washing and infection control measures. Most cases of bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis will self-resolve in 7-10 days and the use of antibiotics is purely to reduce the risk of local complications and prevent subsequent rheumatic fever in children. In adults with bacterial features consider the use of a rapid test to guide whether or not to give antibiotics.

4.2 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection,,
Presentation,"The presentation of these conditions will depend on age, infecting organism and site of infection. Lower respiratory tract infection that may be viral or bacterial in origin. Presents with cough and difficulty breathing often associated with high fevers. Look for signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, and conscious state. Consider admission for any child < 2 months with pneumonia and those with features of severe illness.
Often it is appropriate to manage patients with pneumonia in the community, provided there are no signs of serious illness (such as sepsis), and there is an adequate follow-up plan. 
",
Causes ,"Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is infection below the level of the larynx and may be taken to include:
    - Bronchiolitis (3.2.1).
    - Pneumonia (3.2.2).
    - Bronchitis.
    - Infective exacerbation of COPD/Asthma.
    - Tuberculosis.

[1]",
Investigations,"All patients should have the following measured:
    - Respiratory rate.
    - Heart rate.
    - Oxygen saturations.
    - Blood pressure.
    - Temperature.

Chest X-rays are not routinely available but we can transfer patients for assessment or admission if required. 

Signs of severe pneumonia in adults include tachypnoea >30 Breaths/Min, Tachycardia, Hypotension, low pulse oximetry, cyanosis, confusion and patients over 65.

If a patient with COPD/Asthma has a suspected bacterial LRTI and does not have any focal chest signs (i.e. not pneumonia), then treat for an infective exacerbation of COPD/asthma. If the patient has focal chest signs and COPD then treat as pneumonia, covering suspected atypical organisms and treat wheeze with steroids/inhalers.",
4.2.1 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection - Bronchiolitis,,
Presentation ,"- Severe viral infection of the LRTI in children <2 years.
-  Majority of cases caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and transmitted through droplet inhalation or contact with contaminated secretions.
- Begins as clear nasal discharge for 1 – 2 days, followed by cough and increased work of breathing
- Symptoms will worsen until day 4-5 until begin to resolve. [1,2] – it is important to warn the carer of this and to reassure them.
- Most children are able to be managed at home with symptomatic treatment only, however hospital admission is indicated in cases of severe respiratory distress where oxygen and/or bronchodilators are required.",
Causes,"Most common cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
    - Transmitted through droplet inhalation or contact with contaminated secretions. [3]",
Management,"Health Education [4]
    - Explain to the carer the timeline of the illness and reassure them.
    - Most children able to be manage at home with symptomatic treatment only.
    - Fluid intake, adequate nutrition and appropriate thermoregulation are paramount to optimal management. These should be discussed with the guardians.

Indications for admission [5]
    - Poor feeding (<50% usual intake over the previous 24 hours) which is inadequate to maintain hydration.
    - Lethargy
    - History of apnea
    - Respiratory rate >70 breaths/minute
    - Nasal flaring or grunting
    - Severe chest wall recession

Management,"Calculate the patient’s CRB-65 score in conjunction with clinical judgement (we don’t have urea levels readily available).

A 4-point score system is used, one point for each of:
    - Confusion (abbreviated mental test score 8 or less, or new disorientation in person, place or time).
    - Respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute or more.
    - Systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg (or diastolic below 60 mmHg).
    - Age 65 years or older.


Consider hospital admission for all other patients, particularly those who have a CRB-65 score of 2 or higher.

If well enough to be treated in the community:
    - Increase fluid intake.
    - Advice not to smoke.
    - Treat fever.
    - Advice to seek further medical input or to return for e.g. Friday follow up if clinically necessary.

Pharmacological treatment (consult the BNF/BNF for Children) [1,2]

- 1st line: Amoxicillin 500mg - 1g three times a day for 5 - 7 days.  
       
       Review the patient after 48 - 72 hours.

- 2nd line: Azithromycin 500mg once a day for 3 days (up to 5 days in severe infections). 
        (erythromycin 5 – 7 days is an alternative when azithromycin is unavailable).  

Prescribe WITH amoxicillin IF:
1) Not improved by follow-up.   
2) INITIALLY if the patient has COPD/asthma. 
3) INITIALLY if the patient has severe pneumonia.

If deemed necessary, you may wish to give a stat dose of Ceftriaxone IM/IV before transfer to hospital. On multi day this can be given daily, if transfer not appropriate or possible, until oral step down appropriate (step down antibiotics as above). 

Severe pneumonia requiring IV/IM Ceftriaxone.
- Adults and children >11 years (body weight >50kg).
             2g once a day (IV/IM).
- <28 days:
            20-50 mg/kg (IV infusion)
- 1 month – 11 years (body weight up to 50kg).
            50-80 mg/kg once a day (IV infusion/IM).

Cough over 15 days: Consider TB, patient should be separated from the clinic and asked to use a mask.

5.3 Asthma/COPD,,
Presentation,"Features that increase the probability of asthma in adults include [55, 56,57]:
    - More than one of the following symptoms: wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough, particularly if:
        - Symptoms are worse at night and in the early morning.
        - Symptoms are present in response to exercise, allergen exposure and cold air.
        - Symptoms are present after taking aspirin or beta-blockers.
    - History of atopic disorder.
    - Family history of asthma and/or atopic disorder.
    - Widespread wheeze heard on auscultation of the chest.
    - Otherwise unexplained low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (historical or serial readings).
    - Otherwise unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia.

Frequently, an Asthma diagnosis is made on history and examination alone. Symptoms may include; chronic dry cough (particularly at night), wheeze, and excessive shortness of breath, exacerbated by cold air or exercise. Care must be taken with the differential diagnosis; in children wheezy bronchitis may be mistaken for asthma. In adults, COPD is the main alternative diagnosis. If tropical eosinophilia suspected, then a referral for a full blood count can be made.
For young children or those with difficulty using the inhaler, make a spacer with an empty water bottle. Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family

    - History of recurrent episodes (attacks) of symptoms, ideally corroborated by variable peak flow when symptomatic and asymptomatic.
    - Symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness that vary over time.
    - Recorded observation of wheeze heard by a healthcare professional.
    - Personal/ family history of other atopic conditions (particularly atopic eczema/ dermatitis, allergic rhinitis).
    - No symptoms/ signs to suggest alternative diagnoses.

Exam
'Not all asthma wheezes and all that wheezes is not asthma.'
    - Pay particular attention to pulse (which can be increased due to salbutamol use) and pattern of breathing.
    - Look for chest wall deformities
    - Peak Flow (simple and effective investigation that plays more of a role in the follow up of known asthmatics) [30,33]",
Diagnosis,"Care must be taken with the differential diagnosis58:
    - In children wheezy bronchitis may be mistaken for asthma.
    - In adults, COPD is the main alternative diagnosis (ask about smoking and exposure to causative dusts).

Treat anyone presenting for the first time with a wheeze for potential tropical pulmonary eosinophilia with Albendazole59. This has the resultant effect of concomitant treatment of worms.",
Management (adapted from 56),"Management of chronic asthma

Health Education
    - Inhaler technique is often poor in the communities we visit. Spending time with the patients optimizing their inhaler technique can be extremely effective.
    - Consider making a spacer with an empty water bottle. Ensure a tight seal, observe technique, and educate family.
    - Advise patients about symptoms to watch out for and to seek medical advice should these develop60. Asthma can potentially be life threatening. Therefore it is vital that patients are adequately educated about the condition.
    - Ensure dietary calcium requirements are met - inhaled corticosteroids can affect bone mineralisation. At Floating Doctors, we’re fairly limited with the availability of our medications. Medication choices are based on 2016 SIGN guidelines 56.
    - In adults, consider a trial of treatment with low dose inhaled corticosteroid and provide salbutamol for symptomatic relief. 

In severe cases, consider a short course of oral steroids and referral to hospital.

In children it is important to be wary of the potential side effects that may ensue from chronic steroid use. These must be balanced against the benefits that will result from treatment. If you have any queries or concerns, please consult a Lead Medical Provider.",
Complications,"“Inadequate control of asthma leads to much morbidity and poor quality of life, with a high rate of working days lost and emergency hospital admissions. Complications mostly relate to acute exacerbations:
    - Pneumonia.
    - Pneumothorax.
    - Pneumomediastinum.
    - Respiratory failure and arrest.”61",
,,
3.4 Pulmonary Tuberculosis,,
Presentation,"Pulmonary TB is the commonest initial presentation, however it may also be extra-pulmonary; tuberculosis meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis etc.
The possibility of TB should be considered in any person with risk factors for TB exposure, who has suggestive symptoms 62,63. These include:
    - Fever
    - Malaise
    - Pleuritic chest pain
    - Cough longer than 2-3 weeks
    - Night sweats
    - Weight loss
    - Hemoptysis
    - Clubbing
    - Erythema nodosum",
Causes (adapted from 62),"Pulmonary tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary infection heals spontaneously in immunocompetent patients in 90% of cases.
The following people are at high risk of active TB or reactivation of TB:
    - Older adults
    - Infants
    - People with weakened immune systems, for example due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, diabetes, or medicines that weaken the immune system.

Tuberculosis has been on the rise in Panama 62–64. In 2005, 1,565 cases were reported (48.5 per 100,000 population). The areas at greatest risk are the provinces of Kuna Yala (210 per 100,000 population), Ngöbe Buglé (152.6) and Bocas del Toro (107).",
Investigations,"In cases where Tuberculosis is suspected, discuss with the Clinic Manager and Lead Medical Provider. Depending on the location of the patient, they can be investigated (and subsequently treated) for tuberculosis free of charge through MINSA (Ministerio de Salud).",
Management,"Anti-Tuberculous medications are commenced in a hospital based setting. Our role at Floating Doctors is to act alongside the responsible health authorities.
This can involve educating patients about the following:
    - Side effects of their medications and need for regular monitoring (particularly liver function tests).
    - Potential complications that can ensue.
    - Requirement for family screening if other family members develop alarming symptoms.
    - The requirement to complete the course of therapy prescribed.

Often patients can develop other chest symptoms alongside their tuberculosis (e.g. asthma). These must be addressed where appropriate and not simply brushed under the umbrella term ‘tuberculosis’.",
Complications (taken from 62–65),"- Spinal pain: Back pain and stiffness are common complications of tuberculosis.
- Joint damage: Tuberculous arthritis usually affects the hips and knees.
- Meningitis: This can cause a lasting or intermittent headache that occurs for weeks. Mental changes also are possible.
- Liver or kidney problems
- Heart disorders - Rarely, tuberculosis can infect the tissues that surround your heart, causing inflammation and fluid collections that may interfere with your heart's ability to pump effectively.",
,,
$Gastrointestinal,,
Information,"Gastrointestinal illnesses are very commonly seen in clinic, particularly acute gastroenteritis and gastrointestinal helminth infections. Ascariasis, ancylostomiasis and trichuriasis are some of the most common soil-transmitted helminths in Panama69,70. A big part of trying to prevent the number and severity of infections is to give health education alongside the prescribed medications. Advise patients to wash their hands after using the latrine and before eating, boil their water if they have no clean water supply, peel fruit and vegetables, and cook their meat thoroughly.",
4.1 Albendazole,,
Description,"We routinely give patients and their families a 400 mg tablet of Albendazole for helminths every clinic. For children aged 1-2 years old, a single 200mg tablet can be given66. Albendazole should not be given to children under 1 year.
    - A single dose can treat ascariasis, eosinophilic enterocolitis due to A. caninum, Trichostrongylosis, Hookworm (Necator or Ancylostoma)67,68.
    - For suspected cases of enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), i.e. if they see worms in their stool - advise patients to take another dose 2 weeks after the first one71.

Use in pregnancy69: Albendazole has been shown to have teratogenic and embryotoxic potential in rats and rabbits. Although high priority should be accorded to the treatment of pregnant women, albendazole should not be administered during the first trimester.

Adverse reactions: Transient gastrointestinal discomfort and headache have occasionally been reported.",
4.2 Diarrhea,,
Presentation,"Diarrhea is the abnormal passage of loose or liquid stools more than three times daily and/or a volume of stool greater than 200 g/day72. Acute diarrhea is usually defined as that lasting less than four weeks and chronic diarrhea as that lasting more than four weeks. There are 2 clinical types, diarrhoea with blood (dysentery) and without (60% caused by viruses).",
Causes73,"Infectious diarrhea can happen when:
    - Eating raw, undercooked, unwashed, or improperly handled meat, poultry products, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, shellfish, and seafood.
    - Drinking contaminated water or beverages.
    - Inadvertently ingesting fecal matter, protozoa eggs, or viruses by touching the mouth with dirty or improperly washed hands.

Acute (<4 weeks)
    - Common bacteria causing food and water illnesses: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigellosis, Vibrio cholera, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus.
    - Viral: Norovirus, Rotavirus (Panama vaccinates children against this74)
    - Common protozoa causing food and water illnesses: Amoebiasis, Cryptosporidiosis, Cyclosporiasis, Giardiasis
    - Common foodborne toxins include: Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum.
    - Drugs associated with diarrhea.
    - Constipation with 'overflow diarrhoea'
    - Other causes e.g. food allergy

Chronic (>4 weeks)
    - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
    - Bile acid malabsorption/diarrhoea.
    - Colonic: Diverticular disease, Colonic neoplasia, including colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's/ Microscopic colitis.
    - Small bowel: Coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, Lactose intolerance.
    - Other causes such as chronic pancreatitis or endocrine causes such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus",
Investigations,"Focus history taking on the duration of the illness (acute versus chronic), number of episodes per day and triggers. Specifically ask about whether or not blood and/or worms have been noted in the stool. Assess fluid status (see Dehydration section).",
Management,"Health education75
    - Rehydrate according to Dehydration section
    - Wash raw vegetables thoroughly.
    - Avoid raw food.
    - Boil water.
    - Wash hands before eating.

Pharmacological treatment67
    - Treat patients with Albendazole (as per section 4.1) in all cases except where an alternative cause is suspected.
    - Symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea may be beneficial but should only be used when there is a clear diagnosis of the underlying cause of the diarrhoea. Antispasmodics are occasionally useful for treating abdominal cramp associated with diarrhoea. 
    - Antibacterial drugs are unnecessary for most cases of gastroenteritis but are required for systemic bacterial infection or for some bacterial causes of gastroenteritis such as campylobacter enteritis, shigellosis and salmonellosis.

Arrange emergency admission to hospital if the patient has76:
    - Vomiting and inability to retain oral fluids.
    - Features of severe dehydration or shock.

Other factors that may increase the need for admission include76,77:
    - Older age.
    - Poor home circumstances and level of support.
    - Bloody diarrhoea.
    - Abdominal pain and tenderness (may suggest acute appendicitis or other intra-abdominal cause).
    - Increased risk of poor outcome - e.g. co-existing medical conditions (immunodeficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment).

Patients with persistent diarrhoea >14 days
    - Multivitamins one tablet a day.
    - Zinc supplements OD 10 - 14 days
        - (2-6 months: 10mg, 6 months–5 years: 20mg).
    - Consider HIV test.
    - Stool sample.
    - Referral if associated with weight loss/other red flags.

*we do not prescribe loperamide as we cannot rule out infectious diarrhoea in our setting.

Always consider alternative diagnosis (especially in children); e.g. pneumonia, dengue, malaria, sepsis, UTI.",
Complications (taken from78),"Common complications are metabolic derangement, dehydration, sepsis and lactose intolerance.",
4.3 Dysentery,,
Presentation,"Dysentery is bloody diarrhoea, i.e. any diarrhoeal episode in which the loose or watery stools contain visible red blood79.",
Causes80,"Infections that can present with bloody diarrhoea include cytomegalovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Aeromonas spp., C. difficile, Entamoeba histolytica, schistosomiasis, Ebola virus.",
Investigations,In addition to the investigations that you would perform for a patient with diarrhea; please check patient’s Haemoglobin.,
Diagnosis,"Shigella is the most frequent cause of dysentery. Infection with Shigella is generally self-limited; the average duration of diarrhea is seven days.
Amoebic dysentery is much less common and should be considered if treatment for Shigella fails81. Amoebic dysentery often has a more gradual onset and you may consider the diagnosis if the dysentery has a longer history and the patient is well82.",
Management,"Pharmacological treatment
Antibiotics have shown to decrease the duration of fever and diarrhea caused by Shigella about two days. Shortening the duration of bacterial shedding will reduce the risk of spread.

Follow the above principles, and for suspected Shigella67, give either:
    - Ciprofloxacin
        - Children >25kg and Adults: Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice a day for 3 days.
        - Children <25kg: Azithromycin once a day for 3 days. 

Not all bloody diarrhoea is infectious - always consider inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy and surgical conditions (diverticulitis and colitis)",
Complications,"Common complications are metabolic derangement, dehydration, sepsis and lactose intolerance.",
4.4 Helminth,,
Presentation83,"Helminths are multicellular parasites with complex life cycles within and outside of human hosts. Patients can present themselves with symptoms of bloating, non specific abdominal pain, persistent/intermittent diarrhoea +/- nausea or vomiting. However patients are often asymptomatic.

Whipworm (trichuriasis) specifically can cause loose stools containing mucus and/or blood, nocturnal stooling and rectal prolapse in the setting of heavy infection. Roundworm (ascariasis) is associated with transient respiratory problems in the beginning of infection. While the most common symptom of pinworm (enterobiasis) is perianal itching (predominantly at night).",
Causes,"Roundworm, hookworm and whipworm are some of the most common soil-transmitted helminths in Panama69,70.
Autoinfection occurs by water, food or hands contaminated with soil. Person-to-person transmission can occur by eating food touched by contaminated hands or by handling contaminated cloths, bed linens or other environmental surfaces. In addition, eggs (e.g. of pinworm) may become airborne, inhaled and swallowed. After ingestion eggs hatch and release larvae in the small intestine and the gastrointestinal tract and cause symptoms.

Hookworm is usually transmitted by larval penetration of the human skin. Therefore preventative measures may be to wear shoes.",
Investigations,"Detailed anamnesis; including respiratory problems and the question if patients have seen worms in the stool. Ask for symptoms of anemia since this can be caused by hookworm. Consider doing a Hemoglobin check if available.
Always consider alternative diagnosis especially in children; eg pneumonia, malaria, sepsis, UTI.",
Diagnosis,"For persistent symptoms unresponsive to initial Albendazole treatment consider doing a stool examination. Eggs can be found when infected with i.e. roundworm and whipworm. The utility of stool examination is limited for pinworm since worms and eggs are not generally passed in the stool.
Certain infections can cause peripheral eosinophilia in blood examination.",
Management,"Albendazole every 3 months. 6m-2yrs 200mg once, 2 yrs–Adults 400 mg once.
Patients will often have seen worms in the stool, but not always. For persistent symptoms unresponsive to initial treatment get a stool sample. Give 2 doses, separated by 2 weeks if a large worm burden is suspected (e.g. worms seen in stool, vomiting worms or stunted growth).
In cases of anemia (with suspected hookworm infection); iron supplements can be given together with the treatment.

Health Education
Prevention in endemic areas is extremely difficult. Reinfection is common despite effective therapy. Simultaneous treatment of the households can be warranted given the high transmission rates among families.
Hygienic measures such as clipping of fingernails, frequent handwashing (especially before eating and after defecation), and baths, are also helpful for reducing reinfection and spread of infection. In addition, bedding and clothes should be washed often.
Using treated water and careful washing of vegetables and fruits grown in contaminated areas is also important.",
Complications,"Complications of roundworm may include obstruction of intestine, biliary, and/or pancreatic duct. Pulmonary ascariasis is rare among individuals in highly endemic areas. Other complications of hookworm may include anemia and impaired nutrition.",
,,
,,
4.5 Protozoa,,
Presentation,"Amoebiasis is a parasitic infection due to intestinal protozoa, with faecal oral transmission. Generally it has a subacute onset, usually over one to three weeks. Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery producing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody stools. Rarely, it presents itself extra-intestinal; most commonly with an amoebic liver abscess.",
Causes,"Faecal-oral transmission.
Giardia
Amoebic",
Investigations,"Detailed anamnesis; including respiratory problems and the question if patients have seen worms in the stool. Also ask, for symptoms of anemia (since this can be caused by hookworm).
Always consider alternative diagnosis especially in children; eg pneumonia, malaria, sepsis, UTI.",
Diagnosis,At clinic diagnosis is best accomplished by thorough anamnesis. Obtaining a stool sample can be considered.,
Management,"Hydration (ORS), antibiotics. Avoid anti-diarrheals.
In this setting where stool samples are difficult to obtain, treat any dysentery for Shigella first then Amoebiasis.

Amoebiasis: Metronidazole is effective against the active trophozoite form of the infection. Infection may relapse unless treatment followed by a luminal amebicide to kill the remaining cysts (Diloxanide, Iodoquinol or Paromomycin).

    - Children >10 years and adults: Metronidazole 750 mg three times a day for 5 days.
    - Children <10 years: Metronidazole for 5 day.
        - 1-2 years: 200mg 3 times a day
        - 3-6 years: 200mg 4 times a day
        - 7-9 years: 400mg 3 times a day
    - Treat amoebic dysentery for 5 days, extra-intestinal amoebic infection 5-10 days.

Giardia
For diarrhoea lasting > 7 days consider Giardia:
    - Adults and children >10years: Metronidazole 2g OD for 3 days. (Remember to advise abstinence from alcohol during treatment).
    - Children 1 year-10 years: Metronidazole Once a day for 3 days.(1–2 years 500mg. 3–6 years 600mg. 7–9 years 1g).

Remember to advise abstinence from alcohol during treatment!

Prevention involves avoidance of untreated water; uncooked food such as fruit and vegetables. Amebic cysts are resistant to chlorine at the levels used in water supplies.",
Complications,"Common complications are metabolic derangement, dehydration and lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance can be present as persistent diarrhoea >14 days following an acute diarrhoeal illness. It is also more common with chronic or recurrent episodes of diarrhoea. Typically diarrhoea may be fatty and can present at any age. Management would include reassurance and dietary advice (low lactose formula, eating whole egg or chicken, rice, vegetables and avoid dairy products). If persistent for > 14 days give multivitamins, zinc, magnesium, potassium supplements.",
,,
4.6 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease,,
"Presentation/ Causes/ Investigations 83,84","Patients will often complain of burning epigastric pain, associated with meals, worse lying down, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and an acid taste in their mouth. Gastritis can occur in episodes that last a few days or can be more chronic.
Gastritis can be severely painful and other differentials should be considered such as bowel pathology, pancreatitis, liver abscess, gallstones, AAA, gastric ulcer/cancer and myocardial infarction/angina.",
Diagnosis,"If available at clinic an ECG can be used. Also, a trial of a PPI, Antacid, or nitrate can be used, with a review later in the week, to help you confirm your diagnosis.
Using the Hemocue to check for anemia can be useful.

Care should be taken to differentiate between potential causes. An ECG is available in clinic if needed, and a trial of a PPI, Antacid, or nitrate can be used, with a review later in the week, to help you confirm your diagnosis.

If a skilled ultrasonographer is present, ultrasound can be utilised to image for other potential causes of burning epigastric pain (such as gallstones).",
Management,"General treatment consists of dietary advice and education:
    - Avoid coffee, acidic food, spicy food, alcohol and smoking.
    - Sleep on incline.
    - Do not take NSAIDS.

1. Acute gastritis
    - Mild/Moderate: Dietary advice and Calcium carbonate one tablet as needed.
    - Severe: Dietary advice and omeprazole 20mg - 40mg for 3- 5 days.

2. Chronic gastritis
    - Mild: Dietary advice and Calcium carbonate one tablet as needed.
    - Moderate: Omeprazole 20mg once a day for 4 weeks.
    - Severe: Dietary advice and Omeprazole 40mg for 4 weeks.

3. Gastritis with melaena
    - Omeprazole 40 mg twice a day and urgent referral to hospital.

* Remember to enquire about blood in stool, black stool and/or weight loss. If present, the patient will need hospital admission or referral for endoscopy depending on clinical state.

If symptoms continue after 4 weeks of treatment (as detailed above) then give empirical H. Pylori eradication. If continues after H.pylori treatment then refer patient.

4. Helicobacter Pylori Eradication
    - 1 Acid suppressant:
        - Omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, for 7 days.

4.7 Abdominal Pain,,
Presentation,"Abdominal pain can vary from abdominal discomfort to severe abdominal pain. Other types of pain such as pleuritic/cardiac may be disguised as abdominal pain, especially in children.",
Causes,"The most common causes of abdominal pain that we see include; gastroesophageal
disorders, UTI/pyelonephritis, STI, acute gastroenteritis or parasites. Other surgical conditions must be considered such as gallstones, tumours, renal stones and appendicitis.",
Investigations,"Thorough history and examination are key. Things to enquire about in the history, in addition to nature of pain, include change in bowel habit, appetite, vomiting, fever, weight loss, dysuria and dyspepsia. Look for signs of peritonitis or signs of bowel obstruction that might need urgent referral.

Check pregnancy status and urine dipstick. Hemoglobin might be checked if felt necessary. If available ask a trained ultrasonographer to look eg, gallstones.",
Diagnosis,Depending on the history and investigations. It is important to exclude an acute problem requiring surgery or Gynaecological/ Obstetric problems.,
Management,"Management depends on the symptoms. If symptoms are nonspecific then treat for parasites and follow-up the patient.

Patients with symptoms of peritonitis or signs of bowel obstruction which will need urgent referral! If Gynaecological / Obstetric please go to that section.

Presentation,"Constipation can present itself with any of the following features: straining, lumpy hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, use of digital maneuvers, sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage with 25 percent of bowel movements, and decrease in stool frequency (less than three bowel movements per week).",
Causes,"This is relatively common, some community members do not have regular access to fruit and vegetables. Risk factors for chronic constipation are older age, female gender, diet, physical inactivity.",
Investigations,Take a clear history and identify any signs of underlying pathology. In some cases inspection for hemorrhoids or digital rectal exam may be indicated.,
Diagnosis,"(1) The diagnosis should be based upon the presence of the following for at least 3 months (with symptom onset six months prior to diagnosis):
    - Straining during more that 25% of defecations.
    - Lumpy or hard stools in more than 25% of defecations.
    - Sensation of incomplete evacuation for more that 25% of defecations.
    - Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for more that 25% of defecations.
    - Manual maneuvers to facilitate for more that 25% of defecations.
    - Fewer than three spontaneous bowel movements per week
(2) Loose stools should rarely be present without the use of laxatives
(3) There must be insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.",
Management,"Health Education
    - Advise increase fluid intake and fruit/vegetable consumption.

Pharmacological treatment
    - Adults and children >11 years: Docusate sodium 100 – 200 mg twice a day. Up to 500 mg/day in divided doses.",

5.1 Acute cystitis infection in pregnant women,,
Presentation,"Cystitis is an infection of the bladder and urethra that affects mainly females. Clinical manifestations of cystitis consist of dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, and/or hematuria.",
Causes,"The pathogenesis of urinary tract infection begins with colonization of the vaginal introitus by uropathogens from the fecal flora, followed by ascension via the urethra into the bladder.

The microbial spectrum of uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women consists mainly of Escherichia coli (75 to 95 percent), with occasional other species of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other bacteria such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus

The main risk factors include recent sexual intercourse, recent spermicide use, and a history of urinary tract infection.",
Investigations,"Urinalysis by urine dipstick. Asses for leukocyte esterase, nitrite and haematuria. Leukocytes and nitrates are most accurate for predicting a UTI. Haematuria is useful in ruling out urethritis or vaginitis.
Caution: A dipstick negative for both leukocyte esterase or nitrite cannot be reliably used to rule out infection if the history is strongly suggestive of urinary tract infection.",
Diagnosis,"The clinical diagnosis is made in a presentation consistent with that of a urinary tract infection and is supported by urinalysis evidence of pyuria and/or bacteriuria.
Physical examination is often not necessary for diagnosis in women with typical symptoms of cystitis, but if performed, should include assessment for fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and abdominal examination.",
Management,"Pharmacological Treatment for Uncomplicated UTI
    - Amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 5 days.
    - Co Trimoxazole 160/800 mg tablet twice daily for 3 days. 87",
Complications,"Patients with acute cystitis persistent symptoms after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy or recurrent symptoms within a few weeks of treatment should have evaluation for complicated infection. A complicated urinary tract infection, is associated with an underlying condition that increases the risk of failing therapy. This may include Diabetes, Pregnancy, Acute or Chronic Kidney disease. Empiric treatment should be initiated with another antimicrobial agent. 87 88",
,,
5.2 Acute pyelonephritis,,
"Presentation 83–86,89","Onset is usually rapid with symptoms appearing over a day or two. There is unilateral or bilateral loin pain, suprapubic pain or back pain. Fever is variable but can be high enough to produce rigors. Malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and occasionally diarrhoea occur. There may or may not be accompanying lower urinary tract symptoms with frequency, dysuria, gross haematuria or hesitancy. The patient looks ill and there is commonly pain on firm palpation of one or both kidneys and moderate suprapubic tenderness without guarding.
Presentation in children, especially when young, can be much less specific and culture of urine should be a routine investigation in pyrexial and unwell infants.",
Causes90,"The source of the infection is often ascending infection from the bladder but haematogenous spread can also occur. The usual organisms are the same as for lower urinary tract infection (UTI) - eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterococcus spp.

Incidence is highest in women aged 15-29, followed by infants and older people91.",
Investigations,Our access to investigations will be limited. A urine dipstick can be performed to look for signs of damage to the renal tract or infection. Renal ultrasound may show small kidneys with a thin cortex.,
Management92,"Aims of management are to control active or recurrent infection and to treat/correct any underlying causes.
    - Blood pressure should be controlled to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Ideally angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used. In our setting, consider alternatives in view of the difficulties encountered monitoring them and the potential for dehydration to ensue.
    - Supervening UTI may require lengthier courses of antibiotics than are normally given.
    - In severe cases hospital referral may be necessary.",
Complications93,"    - Progressive renal scarring with reflux nephropathy and CKD.

    - Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma
    - Endometritis

Systemic disorders which cause menorrhagia include109: Hypothyroidism, liver/kidney disease and Von Willebrand's disease.

Contraception110 - particularly IUCDs.

Some cases are associated with anovulatory cycles and this tends to occur around the extremes of reproductive life110,111.

In some women, no cause can be found. This is known as Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding110–112.",
Investigations113,"    - History: Ask about duration of bleeding, cycle length, intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, pelvic pain and any indicators of anaemia or potential systemic diseases.
    - Examine the patient for signs of anaemia. Perform an abdominal examination and where indicated a bimanual examination. Use the Haemocue to check Hemoglobin.
If you are suspected a structural cause and we have an ultrasonographer available, this may be useful in further work up.",
Management,"If the patient is anemic, treat the anemia!

If the history, examination findings are hemoglobin are reassuring it is a feasible option to institute medical treatment113,114 (if necessary). Medical treatment options will depend on our pharmacy inventory but include:
    - Mefenamic acid
    - Tranexamic acid
    - Combined oral contraceptive pill

If suspecting a more sinister cause of menorrhagia, referral to hospital may be necessary.",

5.5.2 Amenorrhea,,
Presentation,"Amenorrhea is defined as the absence or cessation of menstruation115. It can be further subdivided into primary and secondary amenorrhea:
Primary amenorrhea: menses have not occurred by the time of the expected menarche.
Secondary amenorrhea: menstruation has previously occurred but it has stopped.",
Causes,"There are a number of causes of amenorrhea115,116.

Primary
    - Pregnancy, constitutional delay, genitourinary malformation, hyperprolactinaemia, hypothalamic failure, ovarian failure.

Secondary
    - Pregnancy, lactation and menopause are physiological causes of amenorrhea.
    - Contraception (such as Depo which we frequently use)
    - Weight loss
    - Polycystic ovarian syndrome",
Investigations,"Do a pregnancy test!
In the history ask about117: duration, contraceptive use, vasomotor symptoms, galactorrhea, medication history and past medical history.
Check weight and height and calculate BMI
Examine for signs of excessive androgens, the development of secondary sexual characteristics and abdominal masses118.
An ultrasound may be useful if suspecting Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome though bear in mind visualisation of the ovaries can be difficult with transabdominal ultrasounds.",
Management,This will be largely dependent on the underlying cause. Often reassurance (especially in the context of Depo injections) is all that is required. Advise on the need for sufficient oral intake. Referral to hospital may be necessary for further investigation.,

Causes,"The causes of developmental delay are multiple 121:

Delayed Motor Development
Central: Cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, peripheral lesions, visual impairment - affecting fine motor
Systemic disorders: Hypothyroidism etc
Environmental: Malnutrition, lack of practice

Delayed Speech / Language
Central: Autism, global learning difficulty, isolated speech delay, hearing loss.
Environmental: Malnutrition, lack of practice

Global Development Delay
Cerebral malformations, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, chromosomal abnormalities, TORCH infections, toxin exposure, metabolic causes",
Diagnosis,Diagnosis will require referral to hospital. Liaise with a Lead Medical Provider if you suspect Developmental Delay in a patient. The Panamanian system can sometimes offer support (both financial and otherwise) to help the child and their family.,
Management,"Referral to hospital will potentially open up the possibility of multidisciplinary management which would be ideal for the patient and their family122,123.
Otherwise during a Floating Doctors clinic, a provider can educate the family about the likely developmental delay and make them aware of the actions needed depending on the situation. Other options are to educate the local school teachers as developmental delay can impact a child’s school performance.",
,,
6.2 Seizures,,
Presentation124,"“The clinical decision as to whether an epileptic seizure has occurred should be based on the combination of the description of the attack and different symptoms. A detailed history from the patient and any witness is essential.”
Anecdotally, we have found that patients don’t often present with a history of seizures, it is only when exploring symptoms or talking to community members that an individual with epilepsy may be identified.",
Causes,"There are numerous causes of seizures124,125. Seizures can be idiopathic, due to cerebrovascular disease, head injury, drug induced, due to metabolic disturbance amongst other factors.

A particular cause to think about in our setting is central nervous system infection. Panama is known to have relatively high rates of Neurocystericosis126–129 so consider this as a possibility.",
Diagnosis,"Whilst history is crucially important for the diagnosis of a cause of a seizure, it is equally as important that reversible causes are ruled out. As such referral to hospital where blood tests and imaging can be performed is crucial.",
Management,"Identify any potential triggers for seizures and educate accordingly.
Seizures can be triggered124,125,130 by sleep deprivation, medication non-adherence, alcohol, drugs and bright lights.
If a patient is already established on medications, switching over to other ones can be extremely problematic if not monitored adequately. As such this should only be done by a specialist in our setting. If you know a patient is on medication, we can re-supply it. Alternatively, Friday follow up can be utilised to acquire the necessary medication and then provide it to the patient.

For decisions on whether or not to commence new medications, it is usually best to refer onto a specialist. This is because anti-epileptic drugs will often require close monitoring when first initiated 126,127.

Regarding Neurocysticercosis, whilst Albendazole can treat the causative Taenia solium126, it is generally recommended that this be done in a secondary care setting. This is because the killing of the cysticerci can initially worsen inflammation and cerebral oedema126–128. As a result, high dose concomitant steroid therapy may also be required.",
Complications,"“Social stigmatisation and occupational issues. Psychosocial problems: Developmental problems in children with early-onset seizures. Specific cognitive and learning difficulties impacting on education if not recognised. AED side-effects; risk of fetal malformation associated with AEDs. Accidents resulting from a seizure often cause injuries - eg, head injuries, lacerations, fractures and burns.”",
,,
$Cardiovascular,,
7.1 Diabetes,,
Presentation131,"Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia and (in type 1 diabetes) unexplained weight loss.",
Causes132,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus - No insulin production.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Results from resistance to the insulin, often initially with normal or increased levels of circulating insulin.",
Diagnosis133,"Please ensure you are familiar with the different units used to measure BSL (mmol/L and mg/dL) to avoid diagnostic confusion. A conversion chart is available in clinic.

Diagnostic criteria:
Diabetes:
Random BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)
Fasting BSL ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)

Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT):
Random BSL between 7.8 -11.0 mmol/L (140 – 199 mg/dL)
Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG):
Fasting BSL between 5.6 – 6.9 mmol/L (100 – 125 mg/dL)

Patients with IGT and IFG are at high risk of developing Diabetes. These patients should be given the same lifestyle advice as patients with Type 2 Diabetes to help delay the onset of diabetes. The same risk factors should be addressed also.
The diagnosis of IGT is usually made with an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) after abnormally high BSL (but not meeting the criteria for Diabetes). However, the OGTT is not easily available in our setting so ensure these patients have a fasting blood glucose taken and advice/treatment is based on that result.
We do not have access to HbA1c blood tests in Floating Doctors clinics so please utilise the blood glucoses for your diagnostic work up.",
Management,"The management plan for a patient with diabetes involves134:
Diabetes education: structured education and self-management (at diagnosis and regularly reviewed and reinforced) to promote awareness. Diet and lifestyle: healthy diet, weight loss if the person is overweight, smoking cessation, regular physical exercise. Maximising glucose control while minimising adverse effects of treatment, such as hypoglycaemia. Reduction of other risk factors for complications of diabetes, including the early detection and management of hypertension, drug treatment to modify lipid levels and consideration of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Monitoring and early intervention for complications of diabetes, including cardiovascular disease, feet problems, eye problems, kidney problems and neuropathy.
Type 1 - Insulin therapy required. Our pharmacy stock of insulin varies. Please liaise with Lead Medical Providers and the Pharmacy Manager about the types of insulin that we have available.
Generally speaking, if insulin therapy needs to be initiated it is much better for this to be done in a hospital. If the clinical situation is urgent then perform a urine dipstick to look for ketones as diagnostic work up for Diabetic Ketoacidosis. If positive transfer immediately to hospital.

Remember, not give insulin before giving fluid135. This can cause a life threatening fluid shift.

Type 2 Diabetes - Our pharmacy stock is most often limited to Metformin and Glibenclamide. 136,137
Initial treatment with Metformin (when contraindicated or not tolerated, consider dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea) If not adequately regulated on Metformin only, add a DPP-4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea (this is where glibenclamide can be initiated).
Without HbA1c monitoring, it can be difficult to determine a patient’s level of control. Use a combination of history taking, examination findings and the blood sugar on the day of consultation to guide management. Some patients may have MINSA treatment cards. Ask specifically for this.

For patients with diabetes, we have also developed chronic treatment cards. Please liaise with a staff member about this and provide them to patients where necessary.",
"Acute
Complications135,138","Hypoglycaemia
Any blood glucose ≤4.0 mmol/L (72mg/dL) should be treated if the patient is symptomatic. If in doubt about whether or not to treat, it is safer to treat. See the below instructions on this139:
Initially
Glucose 10-20 g is given by mouth, either in liquid form or as granulated sugar (two teaspoons) or sugar lumps.
Repeat capillary blood glucose after 10-15 minutes; if the patient is still hypoglycaemic then the above can be repeated (probably up to 1-3 times).

If hypoglycemia causes unconsciousness, or the patient is uncooperative:
Intravenous administration of 75-80 ml 20% glucose or 150-160 ml of 10% glucose (the volume will be determined by the clinical scenario). Check with the Pharmacy Manager and LMPs about the types of glucose available.At this stage emergency hospital admission will be necessary.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State cannot be diagnosed in our setting. However, if either of the two conditions are suspected - urgently transfer the patient to hospital!",
Chronic Complications,"The management of chronic complications of diabetes can be extremely difficult in our setting.
Complications include139,140:
Cardiovascular disease - advice on the need for optimal blood glucose control should be provided. Modifiable lifestyle factors should also be addressed where appropriate. Diabetic Nephropathy - Perform a urine dipstick in all patients you see. If positive for blood or protein, patients will require work-up in hospital. Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Eye Problems - Attempt fundoscopy in all diabetic patients. Diabetic Neuropathy, Autonomic Neuropathy and Neuropathic Pain and its Management. This may necessitate hospital referral. Often gabapentin can be initiated for troublesome neuropathic pain141. Please consult the BNF for dosing instructions. Diabetic Foot, Leg Ulcers and Painful Foot142. Education, including the importance of routine preventative podiatry care and use of appropriate footwear. The person should check their feet every day and report any sores or cuts that do not heal, any puffiness or swelling and any skin that feels hot to the touch. Frequent, recurrent and persistent infections. Advice on the appropriate recognition of these and tips on how these can be avoided should be given.",
,,
7.2 Hypertension,,
Presentation143,"High blood pressure (HBP) is usually asymptomatic, except where there is accelerated hypertension.
All patients need a full history and physical examination. Look for a cause (renal, endocrine, etc, as above), particularly in the young, the severely hypertensive and those with resistant hypertension144.",
Causes145,"Essential hypertension (primary, cause unknown) accounts for the majority of cases, particularly in the older patient.

Secondary hypertension is commonly caused by renal disease, endocrine conditions or pregnancy. Refer to hospital if you are suspecting secondary hypertension in a patient.

Modifiable risk factors include: Excess weight, Excess dietary salt intake, Lack of physical activity, Excessive alcohol intake, Stress.

Non-modifiable risk factors include: Older age, Family history, Ethnicity (HBP is the most common cardiovascular risk factor among Panamanians and consequently an important public health problem in Panama.146), Gender (BP tends to be higher in men than in women up to the age of 65 years, whereas the opposite tends to be true over the age of 65 years).",
Investigations147–149,"Looking for target-organ damage (these are not always available in our clinic):
Urine dipstick test for protein and blood. Serum creatinine and electrolytes and eGFR (requires hospital work-up). Renal ultrasound scan. 12-lead ECG (looking for LVH or signs of CHD). Echocardiography.Cardiovascular disease prevention:
Fasting blood glucose. Fasting serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (requires hospital work-up).
If a secondary cause is suspected, hospital referral will be required for the appropriate work-up.",
Diagnosis,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the following definitions150:
Stage 1 hypertension - BP in surgery/clinic is ≥140/90 mm Hg and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is ≥135/85 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension - BP in surgery/clinic is ≥160/100 mm Hg and ABPM or HBPM is ≥150/95 mm Hg. Severe hypertension - BP in surgery/clinic is ≥180/110 mm Hg or higher.Diagnosis usually requires Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. Unfortunately this is rarely available in our setting. Thus utilise clinic BP recordings to guide diagnosis. If you are unsure about whether or not to initiate treatment, then utilise the Friday follow up day to recheck blood pressure.",
"Management151,152","Lifestyle interventions
Weight reduction should be suggested if necessary, to maintain an ideal body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2151. Advice to stop smoking where appropriate Encouraging exercise where appropriate - this is often less of a problem for our patients The spread of Western foods to the communities we serve has led to discrepancies in nutritional intake amongst older and younger patients that point to both macro and micronutrient deficiencies153. These differences in diet diversity for older and younger respondents have negative correlations with Body Mass Index and blood glucose. Attempt to educate patients about the negative health effects of unhealthy western foods such sodas and sweets.
Pharmacological Treatment
Our guidelines on the management of hypertension have been decided following careful consideration of the frequency of monitoring available to our population in conjunction with current evidence based practice. Start on monotherapy:

1st line: Amlodipine 5mg OD (can be increased to 10 mg OD)
2nd line: Thiazide diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg OD)
3rd line: Beta blocker",
Complications,"Refer to hospital in case of malignant hypertensive crisis (systolic >200 mm Hg, diastolic >130 mm Hg) accompanied by end-organ damage such as encephalopathy, dissection, pulmonary oedema, nephropathy, eclampsia, papilloedema and/or angiopathic haemolytic anaemia.

In case of hypertensive urgency (systolic ≥180 mmHg, ≥120 mm Hg) without impending end-organ damage. Treatment should safely reduce BP over a few days. Given the setting we are in, admission to hospital should be considered.

Complications of chronic hypertension: stroke or TIA, dementia, left ventricular hypertrophy/ left ventricular strain, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, renal impairment or hypertensive retinopathy.",

Complications,"Main complications are mastoiditis, postauricular fistula, facial palsy, meningitis.",
,,
,,
8.4 Foreign body and Wax,,
Presentation,"Ear Wax acts as an agent to protect the ear, for example from insects – due to the naturally bitter composition of the wax, and to help remove small foreign particles such as dust. Ears are naturally self-cleaning, but on occasion the cerumen may need intervention to remove it. This can occur if there is wax impaction or if there is a foreign body in the ear canal.",
Causes,"In the case of wax impaction, symptoms can include hearing problems, itching, discomfort and tinnitus. Balance may sometimes be affected.",
Investigations,Inspection using otoscope.,
Diagnosis,Made after inspection of the ear.,
Management,"For hard wax resistant to ear wicking dissolve 1/4 tsp sodium bicarbonate in 10 mls of water and irrigate the ear. An alternative is a few drops of acetic acid to soften wax prior to irrigation. Foreign bodies can be removed with tweezers, or irrigation with clean water and a 50ml syringe.

For impacted ear wax: docusate sodium twice a day is also an easy and effective treatment, especially if you want to have another look in a patient's ears for follow up, this will often clear all the wax out in a few days.",

    - Gradual painless loss of vision.
    - Difficulties with reading.
    - Failure to recognise faces.
    - Diplopia in one eye.
    - Haloes",
Causes,"In our population, causative factors include155:
    - Diet (malnutrition).
    - Acute dehydrating diseases.
    - Cumulative exposure to sunlight.
    - In developing countries, cataracts are common in young adults and may be associated with atopy and with diabetes.

Other causative factors include:
    - Age
    - Smoking
    - Systemic corticosteroids",
Diagnosis,"Use ophthalmoscopy to look for a cataract. Look for loss of red reflex, lens opacity, additional visible retinal pathology. Opacities can be seen as defects in the red reflex obtained when the ophthalmoscope is held 60 cm from the eye156. This is best seen with a dilated pupil.

Visual acuity and corrected visual acuity should be recorded for each eye

Ask about ADLs and impact of loss of vision and impact on QOL.

Screen for diabetes",
Management,"There is no definitive prevention or medical treatment available for cataracts155,157.
Surgical removal is the only treatment. Unfortunately, surgery can be hard to come by in our setting. Nonetheless, we keep a record of patients with cataracts so that we can liaise with visiting surgical groups when they do come to the region. We should not promise surgery for patients with cataracts, but we can let them know that they are on our list and that if/when the outside group comes to Bocas, we will be in touch to try to arrange the surgery. List the patient as for ‘Follow Up’ writing ‘Add to Ophthalmology list,’ and try to get a working phone number for the patient if possible.

Provide counselling to use hat and sun glass to prevent progression/development in other eye.

Ensure documentation is good – diagnosis, coding and follow up clearly written, add to the ophthalmology list, with documented visual acuity.

Diagnosis,Diagnosed by clinical examination.,
Management,"The patient should be educated about the causes of pterygium and advised to stay out of dry, dusty environments as much as possible. Sunglasses and lubricating eye drops can be given to try to limit the progression of the pterygium. If the pterygium is aggressive or fast-growing, or if it extends into the pupil, the patient should be added to the ophthalmology list for potential surgical excision.
